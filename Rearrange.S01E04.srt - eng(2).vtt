(Previously)
Alright, fine. I'll agree to play with you guys.

00:00:02.071 --> 00:00:04.883
Do you think I can start a band?

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:08.189
I made this for you.

00:00:08.418 --> 00:00:09.268
Nut.

00:00:09.293 --> 00:00:10.052
How did it go?

00:00:10.077 --> 00:00:11.125
The doctor said it's nothing.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:12.825
Just need to get enough rest, that's all.

00:00:13.191 --> 00:00:15.358
I'll join the band with you.

00:00:15.743 --> 00:00:17.597
This is the reason why

00:00:17.622 --> 00:00:19.196
I don't want anyone buying liquor for her.

00:00:19.221 --> 00:00:20.379
Are you the ones who

00:00:20.404 --> 00:00:22.226
paid for my mother's medical bill?

00:00:22.251 --> 00:00:23.606
I will find a way to pay you back soon.

00:00:23.631 --> 00:00:25.436
In that case, you and your band

00:00:25.461 --> 00:00:27.549
can help me with an event instead, how about that?

Did you write it yourself?

00:02:16.094 --> 00:02:18.499
Oh, Lin. When did you get here?

00:02:19.082 --> 00:02:20.462
A little while ago.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.965
My dad asked me to bring desserts for your parents.

00:02:28.141 --> 00:02:29.622
Wow.

00:02:32.963 --> 00:02:34.110
Thank you.

00:02:34.874 --> 00:02:36.654
So, can you answer me now?

00:02:37.411 --> 00:02:38.404
Answer what?

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:40.046
The song you just played.

00:02:40.391 --> 00:02:42.879
Oh, I wrote it myself.

00:02:43.187 --> 00:02:46.859
Hey, why have I never heard it before?

00:02:48.934 --> 00:02:50.694
It's not finished yet.

00:02:52.544 --> 00:02:54.514
I want to hear the full song.

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:56.068
Hurry up and finish it.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.674
It takes time, Lin.

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:59.953
What's the rush?

00:03:02.763 --> 00:03:03.829
Oh.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.200
But...

00:03:07.662 --> 00:03:09.435
you're moving soon.

00:03:14.673 --> 00:03:16.241
Then you can listen to this part for now.

00:03:18.591 --> 00:03:22.498

00:03:26.552 --> 00:03:29.507
Hey Nut, I'm not going to die.

00:03:29.532 --> 00:03:30.439
Oh, really?

00:03:30.464 --> 00:03:32.159
I'm just moving.

00:03:35.078 --> 00:03:36.786
Speaking of which.

00:03:36.932 --> 00:03:38.661
The next time we meet,

00:03:38.685 --> 00:03:41.577
you'll probably be a famous musician.

00:03:41.805 --> 00:03:43.645
I should get your autograph now.

00:03:48.605 --> 00:03:49.731
My name is Lin.

00:03:49.755 --> 00:03:51.837
I really like listening to your music.

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:03.642
For Lin.

00:04:17.748 --> 00:04:19.401
You thinks...

00:04:21.451 --> 00:04:23.211
Can I really be a musician?

00:04:24.272 --> 00:04:25.356
Of course.

00:04:25.728 --> 00:04:28.322
If you want to be one, you can be.

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:30.441
Just you wait.

00:04:30.465 --> 00:04:32.892
I'll be your number 1 fan.

00:04:50.049 --> 00:04:52.378
In the end, the thing I wanted to avoid the most,

00:04:52.402 --> 00:04:53.963
I couldn't avoid it.

00:05:29.307 --> 00:05:32.211
It's because of adults like you who support them

00:05:32.304 --> 00:05:35.608
that these kids get together and do these useless things.

00:05:37.042 --> 00:05:40.035
But I don't think that kids playing music

00:05:40.342 --> 00:05:42.075
is a useless thing.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.500
My son, Ek,

00:05:44.994 --> 00:05:46.469
he loves playing the drums.

00:05:46.788 --> 00:05:48.512
Since he started playing music,

00:05:48.771 --> 00:05:50.585
his grades have gotten better.

00:05:51.211 --> 00:05:53.371
And much better than before.

00:05:54.141 --> 00:05:56.772
Even now, I still can't find

00:05:56.796 --> 00:05:58.078
this music thing

00:05:58.103 --> 00:06:00.250
that will have any negative impact on my son.

00:06:03.921 --> 00:06:06.389
But my son has more important things to do.

00:06:07.111 --> 00:06:08.784
It's almost entrance exam time.

00:06:09.426 --> 00:06:11.863
Yes, I understand what you're saying.

00:06:12.803 --> 00:06:15.378
But haven't you noticed that

00:06:15.403 --> 00:06:16.457
Nut...

00:06:16.971 --> 00:06:19.112
he looks so happy.

00:06:20.094 --> 00:06:21.387
And another thing,

00:06:22.005 --> 00:06:23.309
you are his father.

00:06:23.769 --> 00:06:25.517
You must know best

00:06:26.141 --> 00:06:28.001
how happy your son is.

00:06:29.869 --> 00:06:32.339
It's just a fleeting happiness.

00:06:32.363 --> 00:06:33.772
It's not sustainable.

00:06:34.459 --> 00:06:35.879
I'm his father, I know best.

00:06:39.625 --> 00:06:40.617
Phichit.

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:43.326
Hey.

00:06:44.141 --> 00:06:45.481
I never thought

00:06:45.747 --> 00:06:46.757
that Nut

00:06:46.781 --> 00:06:49.099
would grow up to be such a good musician.

00:06:49.886 --> 00:06:51.632
He takes after his father.

00:06:52.461 --> 00:06:53.971
Thank you, Mr. Sakda.

00:06:53.995 --> 00:06:55.885
But I myself

00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:57.670
haven't played for a very long time.

00:07:00.283 --> 00:07:01.449
What a shame.

00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:04.606
Do you remember our university days?

00:07:05.223 --> 00:07:07.030
Back then, whenever there was an event,

00:07:07.667 --> 00:07:09.820
Phichit would play the guitar with his friends.

00:07:10.253 --> 00:07:11.612
Do you believe it, Ms. Pen?

00:07:11.636 --> 00:07:14.884
Everyone in the hall gave him a thumbs up.

00:07:15.471 --> 00:07:17.125
You're flattering me too much.

00:07:17.558 --> 00:07:19.332
And where's Lin?

00:07:19.356 --> 00:07:21.939
Oh, Lin. There she is, talking to Nut.

00:07:25.794 --> 00:07:28.259
See? I told you you could do it.

00:07:29.083 --> 00:07:31.806
Thanks, Lin. I didn't expect to see you here.

00:07:31.831 --> 00:07:33.047
How are you?

00:07:33.166 --> 00:07:34.621
I'm doing great.

00:07:34.645 --> 00:07:36.890
My dad just moved back to work around here.

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:39.326
I haven't seen you in so long.

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:40.853
I have so much to tell you.

00:07:41.024 --> 00:07:42.093
Hey, Nut.

00:07:42.263 --> 00:07:44.305
I just went to the school the other day.

00:07:44.329 --> 00:07:46.785
I saw that the old walkway has a roof now.

00:07:47.159 --> 00:07:48.581
When we were studying,

00:07:48.605 --> 00:07:51.421
we had to walk in the sun and get so tanned.

00:07:51.874 --> 00:07:53.215
Yeah, right, Lin.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.668
Since you left,

00:07:54.692 --> 00:07:56.180
the school has improved a lot.

00:07:56.501 --> 00:07:57.230
Hey.

00:07:57.254 --> 00:07:59.681
Are you saying I was holding the school back?

00:08:00.636 --> 00:08:02.216
That's not what I meant, Lin.

00:08:17.027 --> 00:08:18.401
Um...

00:08:18.425 --> 00:08:20.539
How about I introduce you to my friends?

00:08:20.866 --> 00:08:21.866
Sure.

00:08:29.552 --> 00:08:30.592
Everyone.

00:08:31.005 --> 00:08:32.129
This is Lin.

00:08:33.459 --> 00:08:34.826
My friend from middle school.

00:08:36.009 --> 00:08:37.915
Lin, this is Win.

00:08:38.364 --> 00:08:39.626
Our band's lead singer.

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:41.490
This is Chai, the bassist.

00:08:44.949 --> 00:08:47.096
This is Ek, the drummer.

00:08:49.393 --> 00:08:51.901
And this is Biu, our band manager.

00:08:55.544 --> 00:08:58.596
Hi everyone, I'm Lin.

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.711
I really like the song you all played.

00:09:01.011 --> 00:09:02.725
Can I come and listen again?

00:09:03.829 --> 00:09:05.559
You can come every day.

00:09:07.463 --> 00:09:09.310
"You can come every day."

00:09:09.903 --> 00:09:10.939
What's wrong with you?

00:09:10.979 --> 00:09:12.713
You can't see a pretty girl without flirting.

00:09:13.508 --> 00:09:16.263
You're exaggerating. Biu is cuter than me.

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:18.350
This hairstyle is in trend.

00:09:18.374 --> 00:09:21.262
If I did it, I would look terrible.

00:09:22.594 --> 00:09:24.057
Don't praise this little shrimp.

00:09:24.082 --> 00:09:25.369
What's wrong with you, giant?

00:09:25.394 --> 00:09:26.489
You're the shrimp.

00:09:26.514 --> 00:09:27.869
- You're the giant!
- Shorty!

00:09:27.894 --> 00:09:29.616
- You're too tall, you giant!
- You're so short.

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.309
A dog would be taller than you.

00:09:31.334 --> 00:09:33.480
If I'm so short, you're so tall, you titan.

00:09:33.505 --> 00:09:35.476
Titan? You're a little ant.

00:09:35.501 --> 00:09:36.524
But you're too tall too.

00:09:36.549 --> 00:09:39.871
You're not tall at all. Look.

00:09:52.537 --> 00:09:54.937
"Let Nut spend more time with Lin."

00:10:26.354 --> 00:10:29.222
What are you doing? Use your head.

00:10:29.835 --> 00:10:31.887
You're a big boy now.

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:35.329
I'm sorry for secretly playing music.

00:10:36.564 --> 00:10:37.374
But...

00:10:37.398 --> 00:10:38.932
Are you going to talk

00:10:38.956 --> 00:10:41.698
about your stupid dream again?

00:10:42.218 --> 00:10:44.295
How many times have I told you?

00:10:44.319 --> 00:10:46.679
Dreams and reality are two different things.

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:49.058
Dad.

00:10:49.685 --> 00:10:51.535
But this is my life.

00:10:52.148 --> 00:10:53.868
Can I make my own decisions?

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:55.743
Your life.

00:10:56.116 --> 00:10:57.940
It's not just your life.

00:10:58.102 --> 00:10:59.682
It's about the family.

00:10:59.762 --> 00:11:01.709
It's about all the employees of the company.

00:11:01.733 --> 00:11:04.687
The future of the company depends on you.

00:11:05.457 --> 00:11:08.466
I never said I would take over the business from you.

00:11:11.929 --> 00:11:13.288
What did you say?

00:11:13.312 --> 00:11:15.293
Do you even know what you're saying?

00:11:34.505 --> 00:11:36.289
Hello, please come in.

00:11:37.002 --> 00:11:38.236
Please come in.

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:44.046
Please come in.

00:11:46.483 --> 00:11:47.676
Hello, Ms. Duean.

00:11:47.976 --> 00:11:50.113
- Hello, Lin.
- Hello, uncle.

00:11:50.159 --> 00:11:51.553
Here are some desserts.

00:11:51.586 --> 00:11:53.514
Oh, thank you very much.

00:11:54.718 --> 00:11:57.245
You don't have to bring anything next time.

00:11:57.953 --> 00:11:59.639
Please have a seat.

00:12:04.108 --> 00:12:06.523
Lin, you can sit next to Nut.

00:12:06.547 --> 00:12:08.339
Long time no see, now you can talk.

00:12:09.056 --> 00:12:10.474
Please, Mr. Sakda.

00:12:10.498 --> 00:12:11.585
Please, Ms. Duean.

00:12:11.612 --> 00:12:13.019
Please.

00:12:25.043 --> 00:12:27.649
Oh, Nut, I have something for you.

00:12:32.418 --> 00:12:33.351
Oh.

00:12:37.377 --> 00:12:38.897
Where did you get this?

00:12:40.625 --> 00:12:42.187
This design is very rare.

00:12:42.682 --> 00:12:44.038
I just happened to find it.

00:12:44.062 --> 00:12:45.468
I knew you would like it.

00:12:47.278 --> 00:12:48.439
Thank you, Lin.

00:12:50.291 --> 00:12:52.077
Thank you very much, Lin.

00:12:53.019 --> 00:12:53.958
You're welcome, uncle.

00:12:53.982 --> 00:12:57.298
I fully support Nut, if it's about music.

00:13:00.189 --> 00:13:01.304
So, Lin...

00:13:01.702 --> 00:13:03.234
she likes listening to music.

00:13:03.258 --> 00:13:04.533
This morning,

00:13:04.557 --> 00:13:07.633
she couldn't stop praising Nut to me.

00:13:08.069 --> 00:13:10.018
Well, Nut is really good.

00:13:10.042 --> 00:13:12.858
Especially now, he's much better than before.

00:13:14.144 --> 00:13:17.301
I think we should eat now before it gets cold.

00:13:17.919 --> 00:13:19.080
Eat a lot, Lin.

00:13:19.127 --> 00:13:20.574
Okay, uncle.

00:13:22.745 --> 00:13:24.200
Thank you.

00:13:24.224 --> 00:13:25.767
You came at the right time.

00:13:25.791 --> 00:13:28.346
- Do you want a lot?
- Not too much, thank you.

00:13:28.371 --> 00:13:29.379
Okay.

00:13:30.402 --> 00:13:32.223
Thank you very much.

00:13:35.277 --> 00:13:36.444
Is that a lot?

00:14:04.959 --> 00:14:06.326
Bro.

00:14:07.656 --> 00:14:08.903
What's up, Win?

00:14:09.374 --> 00:14:10.861
Do you ever sleep?

00:14:14.391 --> 00:14:16.300
You know I'm a rocker.

00:14:16.992 --> 00:14:18.806
What rocker sleeps?

00:14:22.339 --> 00:14:24.672
I'll get plenty of sleep when I'm dead.

00:14:27.667 --> 00:14:29.860
Life has so much more to offer, brother.

00:14:30.813 --> 00:14:33.526
Don't you want to see who you love grow up?

00:14:35.496 --> 00:14:36.501
Win.

00:14:37.082 --> 00:14:38.862
How old are you, huh?

00:14:39.252 --> 00:14:41.752
You talk like an old man.

00:14:44.767 --> 00:14:46.327
I'm just worried.

00:14:50.659 --> 00:14:51.669
Hey, bro.

00:14:55.069 --> 00:14:56.278
Do you...

00:14:56.425 --> 00:15:00.105
have any plans to travel out of town soon?

00:15:03.749 --> 00:15:05.314
Soon?

00:15:07.219 --> 00:15:09.016
Soon...

00:15:10.795 --> 00:15:12.162
Hello, Phop.

00:15:13.389 --> 00:15:15.884
Hi guys, the usual room?

00:15:16.229 --> 00:15:17.352
Okay, okay.

00:15:17.376 --> 00:15:18.870
I'll go open the room for you.

00:15:33.735 --> 00:15:35.095
Hey, Nut.

00:15:35.767 --> 00:15:37.400
I thought I wouldn't see you again.

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:41.403
I thought you'd be grounded without seeing daylight.

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:44.226
I survived because of Lin.

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:45.165
My dad's always

00:15:45.189 --> 00:15:47.026
in a good mood whenever he sees Lin.

00:15:48.068 --> 00:15:49.848
Like an angel.

00:15:51.864 --> 00:15:53.017
Guys.

00:15:53.389 --> 00:15:55.257
I can't find the video camera.

00:15:57.669 --> 00:15:59.344
You forgot it at event.

00:15:59.368 --> 00:16:00.889
Lin kept it for you.

00:16:02.389 --> 00:16:03.277
Thanks.

00:16:03.302 --> 00:16:04.796
A true angel.

00:16:05.625 --> 00:16:07.022
Sorry, guys.

00:16:07.046 --> 00:16:08.557
I've been a bit out of it lately.

00:16:08.581 --> 00:16:10.780
I've been busy with the photography club's.

00:16:13.838 --> 00:16:15.981
How about this? While you're busy,

00:16:16.006 --> 00:16:17.680
I'll have Lin help out with the band for a while.

00:16:18.163 --> 00:16:20.158
That way you can focus on your work.

00:16:20.258 --> 00:16:23.038
But won't that be too much of a bother for her?

00:16:23.349 --> 00:16:24.958
No, I know Lin well.

00:16:25.674 --> 00:16:26.809
I'll talk to her.

00:16:27.322 --> 00:16:28.631
What do you all think?

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:30.766
Let's do it.

00:16:31.252 --> 00:16:32.446
Great.

00:16:35.858 --> 00:16:37.284
What do you think, Win?

00:16:45.129 --> 00:16:46.217
Well...

00:16:47.083 --> 00:16:48.270
That's it.

00:16:49.798 --> 00:16:50.940
Let's start practicing.

00:16:51.546 --> 00:16:52.838
Biu, don't forget to record.

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:54.962
You're in a hurry.

00:17:01.611 --> 00:17:03.478
Here's the drink.

00:17:10.129 --> 00:17:11.091
Here, Chai.

00:17:11.116 --> 00:17:12.356
Thanks.

00:17:12.858 --> 00:17:13.584
Ek.

00:17:13.609 --> 00:17:14.604
Thank you.

00:17:15.666 --> 00:17:16.666
Mmm.

00:17:17.152 --> 00:17:21.113
Sweet and refreshing, just like you.

00:17:21.857 --> 00:17:23.744
And you didn't buy the wrong thing either.

00:17:24.207 --> 00:17:25.541
Can I apologize?

00:17:25.565 --> 00:17:27.043
I was out of focus.

00:17:27.068 --> 00:17:28.602
How many times are you talk about that?

00:17:28.689 --> 00:17:29.702
100 times.

00:17:30.166 --> 00:17:31.206
"100 times."

00:17:36.766 --> 00:17:38.153
Here, this is for Biu.

00:17:38.809 --> 00:17:39.869
Thanks.

00:17:46.274 --> 00:17:47.441
Here, Win.

00:17:56.101 --> 00:17:58.360
And this is for Nut.

00:18:01.736 --> 00:18:03.016
Thank you, Lin.

00:18:04.431 --> 00:18:05.468
Oh, Nut.

00:18:05.492 --> 00:18:07.299
Wanna go to the Alangkarn concert?

00:18:07.672 --> 00:18:09.232
I really want to go.

00:18:09.981 --> 00:18:10.914
But...

00:18:11.354 --> 00:18:12.854
My dad probably won't let me go.

00:18:15.045 --> 00:18:16.863
Should I ask your dad for you?

00:18:18.649 --> 00:18:19.671
Nut...

00:18:20.997 --> 00:18:22.351
So...

00:18:22.411 --> 00:18:24.298
I have something important to talk, right now.

00:18:24.718 --> 00:18:25.858
Can we?

00:18:26.671 --> 00:18:27.698
Sure.

00:19:00.599 --> 00:19:01.658
Oh.

00:19:02.012 --> 00:19:03.112
Hey.

00:19:03.452 --> 00:19:04.799
Your driver hasn't come yet?

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:06.744
That's right.

00:19:07.363 --> 00:19:08.903
It's late today.

00:19:11.777 --> 00:19:13.057
Want me to give you a ride?

00:19:14.961 --> 00:19:17.262
Let me call my mom first.

00:19:17.902 --> 00:19:18.996
Sure.

00:19:27.912 --> 00:19:29.346
Hello, Mom.

00:19:29.707 --> 00:19:30.824
Ton hasn't arrived yet.

00:19:30.848 --> 00:19:32.596
Can I go home with Chai?

00:19:33.961 --> 00:19:35.768
How will you get home, Ek?

00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:37.951
Chai will give me a ride on his motorcycle.

00:19:39.638 --> 00:19:42.299
But riding a motorcycle is dangerous, Ek.

00:19:42.679 --> 00:19:44.049
You don't have to worry, Mom.

00:19:44.073 --> 00:19:46.414
Chai is a very good motorcycle rider.

00:19:46.889 --> 00:19:48.149
Please, Mom.

00:19:49.397 --> 00:19:51.017
Okay, okay.

00:19:55.669 --> 00:19:56.893
So?

00:19:57.526 --> 00:19:58.734
Is it okay?

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:00.894
Get on.

00:20:04.589 --> 00:20:06.956
Hey, but there's only one helmet.

00:20:08.429 --> 00:20:09.991
Are you going to wear it or am I?

00:20:11.109 --> 00:20:13.024
You should wear it, you're the driver.

00:20:15.199 --> 00:20:17.436
If I fall, you'll get hurt too.

00:20:18.253 --> 00:20:19.655
You'll be the only one who gets hurt.

00:20:20.287 --> 00:20:22.662
Then why drive in a way that makes you fall?

00:20:24.207 --> 00:20:25.380
Oh.

00:20:26.539 --> 00:20:27.666
Are you on yet?

00:20:28.399 --> 00:20:29.492
Let's go.

00:20:31.043 --> 00:20:32.799
This is your order.

00:20:32.824 --> 00:20:34.604
Would you like some black pepper?

00:20:34.775 --> 00:20:35.666
Yes, please.

00:20:35.691 --> 00:20:37.186
Excuse me.

00:20:44.385 --> 00:20:45.556
I'm going to eat now.

00:20:52.556 --> 00:20:53.946
So delicious.

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:55.698
Mmm, so delicious.

00:21:02.942 --> 00:21:04.215
Here.

00:21:05.075 --> 00:21:06.132
That's enough.

00:21:06.156 --> 00:21:08.547
I'll turn into a rabbit from eating all your food.

00:21:09.214 --> 00:21:11.140
Just eat it. It's good for you.

00:21:16.405 --> 00:21:18.356
What about you? Have you eaten?

00:21:19.989 --> 00:21:21.256
I already ate.

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.321
When?

00:21:24.149 --> 00:21:25.562
I already ate.

00:21:35.376 --> 00:21:36.631
Isn't it good for you?

00:21:36.655 --> 00:21:37.909
Eat up.

00:21:41.237 --> 00:21:42.917
What are you playing at, Nut?

00:21:47.229 --> 00:21:50.192
You said you wanted to talk to me.

00:21:50.699 --> 00:21:51.933
What was it?

00:21:55.233 --> 00:21:56.573
Um...

00:21:56.972 --> 00:21:58.312
Try to guess.

00:22:00.635 --> 00:22:01.866
About the band?

00:22:02.791 --> 00:22:03.971
Mmm.

00:22:04.377 --> 00:22:07.185
I want to talk to you about the band.

00:22:07.851 --> 00:22:10.080
So, I saw that...

00:22:10.104 --> 00:22:11.739
we're getting close to the competition.

00:22:11.763 --> 00:22:13.763
So I wanted to practice more.

00:22:16.305 --> 00:22:17.623
Is that all?

00:22:19.917 --> 00:22:21.045
Yeah.

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:22.802
Then why didn't you say so at the rehearsal room?

00:22:26.344 --> 00:22:27.487
Well...

00:22:27.511 --> 00:22:29.339
I wanted to talk to you alone.

00:22:30.518 --> 00:22:31.738
Is not okay?

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.340
Okay.

00:22:41.471 --> 00:22:42.885
Sure.

00:22:42.909 --> 00:22:44.030
Then...

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:47.398
I'll tell Lin and Biu to schedule more practices.

00:23:06.906 --> 00:23:08.040
Hey, Nut.

00:23:08.921 --> 00:23:11.321
Can I ask you something?

00:23:13.214 --> 00:23:14.241
What is it?

00:23:16.609 --> 00:23:18.296
When you went to the doctor,

00:23:19.095 --> 00:23:21.535
Did he really say that you're completely fine?

00:23:24.722 --> 00:23:25.815
Yeah.

00:23:27.276 --> 00:23:28.544
Completely fine.

00:23:29.958 --> 00:23:32.624
Why do you keep asking?

00:23:36.054 --> 00:23:37.374
Nothing.

00:23:37.986 --> 00:23:39.366
It's good that you're fine.

00:23:45.384 --> 00:23:46.773
Are you worried about me?

00:23:53.606 --> 00:23:54.841
Yeah.

00:23:55.526 --> 00:23:56.881
I'm worried about you.

00:23:59.498 --> 00:24:01.031
Because if you get sick,

00:24:02.473 --> 00:24:03.953
who will be my guitarist?

00:24:07.809 --> 00:24:09.021
Here, eat up.

00:24:09.045 --> 00:24:11.141
That's enough, Win.

00:24:11.165 --> 00:24:13.422
I'm going to turn into a plant.

00:24:13.446 --> 00:24:14.976
Why don't you eat some?

00:24:15.322 --> 00:24:16.855
You only give it to me.

00:24:19.028 --> 00:24:19.990
Only give me vegetables

00:24:20.014 --> 00:24:21.468
because you don't wanna eat, right?

00:24:23.016 --> 00:24:25.224
So you just keep feeding them to me.

00:24:25.402 --> 00:24:26.959
Bring your mouth here.

00:24:33.234 --> 00:24:34.574
Are you in a hurry?

00:24:34.598 --> 00:24:36.025
I want to eat Mookata.

00:24:36.049 --> 00:24:37.975
Sure, but I've never had it before.

00:24:37.999 --> 00:24:39.599
Yeah, I'll take you.

00:24:57.653 --> 00:24:59.401
You've really never had Mookata before?

00:25:00.521 --> 00:25:01.788
Never.

00:25:03.651 --> 00:25:04.858
Give me the plate.

00:25:05.111 --> 00:25:06.391
I'll do it for you.

00:25:19.376 --> 00:25:21.910
You're so old and you've never had Mookata.

00:25:23.918 --> 00:25:25.945
Are you really living your life to the fullest?

00:25:31.184 --> 00:25:32.437
Here.

00:25:35.984 --> 00:25:37.468
Pick up the pork like this.

00:25:41.142 --> 00:25:42.861
And this is the dipping sauce.

00:25:43.668 --> 00:25:45.008
And then dip it in.

00:25:46.202 --> 00:25:47.624
And then put it in your mouth.

00:25:53.772 --> 00:25:55.056
It's so delicious.

00:25:56.018 --> 00:25:57.118
Of course.

00:25:57.464 --> 00:25:58.846
My cooking is always delicious.

00:25:59.292 --> 00:26:00.516
Eat a lot.

00:26:19.704 --> 00:26:20.744
What are you looking at?

00:26:21.881 --> 00:26:23.234
Is that girl at that table cute?

00:26:24.158 --> 00:26:26.105
No, I was looking at the hat.

00:26:29.362 --> 00:26:30.462
Why?

00:26:33.342 --> 00:26:34.505
So here's the thing.

00:26:34.529 --> 00:26:36.044
I used to be very shy.

00:26:36.111 --> 00:26:37.554
I couldn't look anyone in the eye.

00:26:37.578 --> 00:26:38.970
So I had to wear a hat all the time.

00:26:39.499 --> 00:26:40.710
Back then,

00:26:40.734 --> 00:26:42.668
I had a lot of hats like this.

00:26:43.843 --> 00:26:44.876
And now?

00:26:46.056 --> 00:26:48.769
Now, I'm just missing that one.

00:26:50.116 --> 00:26:52.197
I mean, are you still shy now?

00:26:53.939 --> 00:26:55.239
Much better now.

00:27:03.196 --> 00:27:05.791
Are you okay?

00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:09.770
Try looking me in the eye.

00:27:26.191 --> 00:27:28.460
Eat the pork, it's getting burnt.

00:27:31.501 --> 00:27:32.834
That patterned hat,

00:27:32.974 --> 00:27:34.360
I have one at home.

00:27:35.828 --> 00:27:36.908
Really?

00:27:37.121 --> 00:27:39.456
But it sold out so fast when it was released.

00:27:42.886 --> 00:27:45.119
I found it second-hand at Khlong Thom Market.

00:27:45.746 --> 00:27:47.926
The pattern was strange, so I bought it.

00:27:48.446 --> 00:27:50.678
Do you want it? It's still like new.

00:27:51.777 --> 00:27:53.224
Are you really going to give it to me?

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:55.266
Yeah.

00:27:55.669 --> 00:27:57.126
With me, it's just a hat.

00:27:57.608 --> 00:27:59.761
With you, it might become something important.

00:28:03.458 --> 00:28:05.136
What are you smiling about?

00:28:05.663 --> 00:28:06.866
Eat up.

00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:08.405
Help me flip the pork.

00:28:15.025 --> 00:28:17.833
♪ Sky can still change. ♪

00:28:17.858 --> 00:28:21.381
♪ Why hold on to the heartache? ♪

00:28:21.406 --> 00:28:25.186
♪ There is a long way ahead for you. ♪

00:28:26.356 --> 00:28:27.788
We like the same song.

00:28:29.087 --> 00:28:30.975
You like Alangkarn band too?

00:28:31.226 --> 00:28:33.655
Hey, I can sing all their songs.

00:28:33.679 --> 00:28:34.739
Really?

00:28:35.506 --> 00:28:37.205
I can only sing the chorus.

00:28:39.371 --> 00:28:41.972
Did you watch Jeeab on "At Ten" last night?

00:28:42.387 --> 00:28:44.602
No, I didn't. Why?

00:28:44.627 --> 00:28:47.535
Jeeab accidentally revealed a song from the new album.

00:28:47.559 --> 00:28:48.453
Really?

00:28:48.939 --> 00:28:50.106
What song?

00:28:50.446 --> 00:28:51.739
"Stop It Now".

00:28:54.029 --> 00:28:55.642
"Stop It Now".

00:28:57.949 --> 00:28:59.250
Biu, let's go.

00:28:59.601 --> 00:29:00.595
Let's go.

00:29:07.274 --> 00:29:09.993
I think we should go back and wait inside.

00:29:21.729 --> 00:29:22.776
Hey.

00:29:23.255 --> 00:29:25.104
Nut! Nut!

00:29:33.575 --> 00:29:34.827
Why are you running?

00:29:34.851 --> 00:29:36.443
You're going to faint again.

00:29:36.717 --> 00:29:38.717
Do you see me as that weak?

00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:40.376
I'm serious.

00:29:45.298 --> 00:29:47.671
Okay, I get it.

00:29:48.051 --> 00:29:49.828
If I feel like I'm not well,

00:29:49.852 --> 00:29:52.086
if I'm about to faint,

00:29:53.238 --> 00:29:54.657
I'll tell you first.

00:29:56.361 --> 00:29:57.889
Stop worrying about me.

00:30:03.885 --> 00:30:05.340
Wait for me, Nut.

00:30:46.485 --> 00:30:48.051
Or the future...

00:30:48.271 --> 00:30:49.778
can really be changed.

00:31:11.556 --> 00:31:13.784
Let Nut spend more time with Lin.

00:31:15.815 --> 00:31:17.108
Do you think...

00:31:19.475 --> 00:31:20.955
If Nut doesn't die,

00:31:24.865 --> 00:31:26.885
Will Nut and I get married?

00:32:29.741 --> 00:32:31.541
What are you looking for?

00:32:32.406 --> 00:32:33.752
I'm looking for my hat, Mom.

00:32:34.861 --> 00:32:38.566
Why do you have to rummage through so much?

00:32:39.775 --> 00:32:42.929
Have you seen that black hat?

00:32:43.335 --> 00:32:44.909
The one with the strange pattern?

00:32:45.651 --> 00:32:49.052
I've never seen you want to wear it.

00:32:49.076 --> 00:32:51.418
Why are you searching for so much stuff today?

00:32:51.598 --> 00:32:53.531
I'm going to give it to Ek.

00:32:55.817 --> 00:32:57.263
Then hurry up and go to school.

00:32:57.288 --> 00:32:58.516
I'll look for it.

00:32:59.716 --> 00:33:00.939
Okay, okay.

00:33:00.963 --> 00:33:03.050
Please help me find it.

00:33:03.463 --> 00:33:04.552
I'm going to school now.

00:33:04.577 --> 00:33:06.249
Mmm, go ahead.

00:33:18.861 --> 00:33:19.842
Nut.

00:33:19.866 --> 00:33:21.821
You bring a lunchbox to eat now?

00:33:22.862 --> 00:33:24.202
Oh, this?

00:33:24.615 --> 00:33:25.695
Win made it for me.

00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:28.613
Oh.

00:33:29.118 --> 00:33:30.850
Where's Win today?

00:33:30.874 --> 00:33:32.661
Aren't going to the rehearsal room together?

00:33:33.234 --> 00:33:34.328
Win?

00:33:34.994 --> 00:33:36.527
He said he had something to do.

00:33:37.516 --> 00:33:39.296
He'll probably meet us at the rehearsal room.

00:33:41.898 --> 00:33:43.018
Should we go now?

00:33:43.539 --> 00:33:44.472
Let's go.

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:54.547
Excuse me.

00:33:55.670 --> 00:33:56.713
I'd like to know the test results

00:33:56.737 --> 00:33:58.494
of Mr. Natthanan Tiwanich.

00:33:58.519 --> 00:34:00.313
What is your relationship to the patient?

00:34:00.597 --> 00:34:01.671
I'm a friend.

00:34:02.039 --> 00:34:03.989
The hospital cannot disclose test results

00:34:04.013 --> 00:34:06.725
to anyone other than the patient's relatives.

00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:08.748
Or you must have a power of attorney.

00:34:08.772 --> 00:34:10.153
Do you have one?

00:34:11.357 --> 00:34:12.517
No, I don't.

00:34:12.824 --> 00:34:14.703
Then I'm really sorry.

00:34:40.229 --> 00:34:42.031
You're still young.

00:34:42.384 --> 00:34:45.192
Don't make such a serious face, you'll get old fast.

00:34:47.069 --> 00:34:49.838
I'm just thinking about things, bro.

00:34:54.149 --> 00:34:55.309
Hey, Win.

00:34:56.029 --> 00:34:58.495
Next week I'm closing the shop for a few days.

00:34:58.835 --> 00:35:00.729
I'm going to take my girlfriend to the beach.

00:35:03.176 --> 00:35:04.841
If it's around this time, I think...

00:35:05.492 --> 00:35:07.006
You shouldn't go yet.

00:35:08.109 --> 00:35:09.226
Why?

00:35:10.031 --> 00:35:11.299
But...

00:35:11.324 --> 00:35:13.059
my girlfriend wants to go.

00:35:13.083 --> 00:35:14.669
How can I go against her wishes?

00:35:18.219 --> 00:35:19.521
Hey, what?

00:35:19.545 --> 00:35:20.434
Bro.

00:35:20.459 --> 00:35:21.748
Did you forget that

00:35:21.773 --> 00:35:23.990
next week there's an Alangkarn concert?

00:35:24.343 --> 00:35:25.686
And if you don't go on a trip,

00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:27.290
I'll buy you a concert ticket.

00:35:27.314 --> 00:35:28.264
Hey.

00:35:29.274 --> 00:35:30.799
What's with all that?

00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:34.427
Yeah.

00:35:36.899 --> 00:35:39.465
I wanan go, but I've already booked the hotel.

00:35:40.579 --> 00:35:41.556
Bro.

00:35:41.871 --> 00:35:44.297
But this is our favorite band's concert.

00:35:44.489 --> 00:35:46.819
And you know that when I go to a rock concert,

00:35:47.129 --> 00:35:49.769
I have to go with a rocker like you to have fun.

00:35:52.869 --> 00:35:53.945
So?

00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:06.107
Hey, Chai.

00:36:06.203 --> 00:36:08.500
If you could choose to play another position,

00:36:08.524 --> 00:36:09.557
who would you play for?

00:36:10.104 --> 00:36:11.313
The drummer.

00:36:11.337 --> 00:36:12.153
Why?

00:36:12.177 --> 00:36:13.424
He doesn't play well.

00:36:14.699 --> 00:36:15.992
Just kidding.

00:36:16.017 --> 00:36:17.132
Probably.

00:36:21.959 --> 00:36:23.012
Biu.

00:36:23.285 --> 00:36:25.580
The song "Stop It Now" that we talked about yesterday,

00:36:25.605 --> 00:36:27.331
last night on the Tonight Show,

00:36:27.356 --> 00:36:30.179
Jeeab sang it live, and it was so beautiful.

00:36:30.552 --> 00:36:32.578
I recorded it for you to listen to.

00:36:36.149 --> 00:36:38.609
♪ No way to go ♪

00:36:38.634 --> 00:36:41.155

Wow.

00:36:49.202 --> 00:36:50.381
It's really beautiful.

00:36:51.822 --> 00:36:52.869
Right?

00:36:55.366 --> 00:36:56.312
Nut.

00:36:56.966 --> 00:36:58.499
Let's go eat at our usual chicken stir-fry place.

00:36:59.356 --> 00:37:01.568
Yeah, let's go. I haven't eaten there in a while.

00:37:01.814 --> 00:37:03.095
Guys, I'm going now.

00:37:03.514 --> 00:37:04.781
Yeah.

00:37:30.472 --> 00:37:32.925
Why are you so angry at the pinecone?

00:37:35.046 --> 00:37:36.219
I'm not angry.

00:37:37.005 --> 00:37:38.967
It's fun. Want to try?

00:37:48.039 --> 00:37:49.338
It's not fun at all.

00:37:53.396 --> 00:37:55.162
What's wrong with you?

00:37:55.854 --> 00:37:57.537
You've been pouting since just now.

00:37:59.292 --> 00:38:00.572
Am I pouting?

00:38:00.638 --> 00:38:01.635
Yeah.

00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:02.683
Not at all.

00:38:02.708 --> 00:38:04.262
Actually, I'm really happy

00:38:04.286 --> 00:38:05.712
to be able to go home with you today.

00:38:05.878 --> 00:38:06.824
Liar.

00:38:06.848 --> 00:38:08.022
I saw you.

00:38:08.675 --> 00:38:09.594
Saw what?

00:38:09.619 --> 00:38:10.942
The look in your eyes.

00:38:11.766 --> 00:38:12.934
What's wrong with my eyes?

00:38:13.189 --> 00:38:15.106
The way you look at Nut.

00:38:15.419 --> 00:38:16.686
You like him?

00:38:19.949 --> 00:38:21.383
You're being ridiculous.

00:38:21.774 --> 00:38:23.384
Don't try to hide it from me.

00:38:23.408 --> 00:38:25.410
I've known you since...

00:38:26.963 --> 00:38:27.764
Hey.

00:38:28.189 --> 00:38:29.405
What's wrong with you?

00:38:32.528 --> 00:38:34.917
You like him, why don't you flirt with him?

00:38:41.927 --> 00:38:42.938
And...

00:38:44.374 --> 00:38:45.921
What if he doesn't like me back?

00:38:45.946 --> 00:38:48.479
See, you admit it. You like him.

00:38:50.149 --> 00:38:51.203
Yeah.

00:38:52.018 --> 00:38:54.218
I can't lie to you?

00:38:55.749 --> 00:38:58.816
Then why did you let Nut go with Lin so easily?

00:39:03.188 --> 00:39:05.481
You don't have to get involved.

00:39:06.815 --> 00:39:08.242
I want to get involved.

00:39:57.317 --> 00:39:58.764
What's gotten into you today?

00:39:59.598 --> 00:40:01.358
I haven't heard you play in a long time.

00:40:03.253 --> 00:40:04.386
Are you okay, bro?

00:40:07.201 --> 00:40:08.309
I'm fine.

00:40:12.788 --> 00:40:14.161
Can I ask you something?

00:40:19.742 --> 00:40:20.943
If...

00:40:22.393 --> 00:40:24.573
we've ever done something wrong to someone,

00:40:25.237 --> 00:40:26.990
but we can fix it.

00:40:28.727 --> 00:40:30.147
Should we fix it?

00:40:30.786 --> 00:40:32.806
Mmm, you should fix it.

00:40:38.762 --> 00:40:40.634
But what if fixing it

00:40:40.659 --> 00:40:42.632
will make us feel really bad?

00:40:44.971 --> 00:40:46.178
Then...

00:40:46.593 --> 00:40:48.453
You have to choose.

00:40:49.559 --> 00:40:50.909
But I think...

00:40:50.939 --> 00:40:54.119
your friend wouldn't want you to be sad.

00:41:02.525 --> 00:41:03.792
And if one day

00:41:05.626 --> 00:41:07.113
I'm a bad brother,

00:41:08.475 --> 00:41:10.570
do bad things.

00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:15.446
Will you still be a nice to me like this?

00:41:15.896 --> 00:41:17.790
Mmm, I will.

00:41:31.562 --> 00:41:32.852
I'm sorry.

00:41:34.215 --> 00:41:35.635
What are you sorry for?

00:41:39.743 --> 00:41:40.870
Nothing.

00:41:41.784 --> 00:41:43.131
Go play the guitar.

00:42:03.178 --> 00:42:04.371
Hey, Win.

00:42:04.734 --> 00:42:06.321
You're really serious.

00:42:06.961 --> 00:42:08.307
Of course, I am.

00:42:09.888 --> 00:42:10.890
Okay.

00:42:11.129 --> 00:42:12.624
I guess I have to go then.

00:42:15.069 --> 00:42:17.427
Do you think they'll play "Stop It Now"?

00:42:17.451 --> 00:42:19.291
I really want to hear it.

00:42:20.669 --> 00:42:22.319
The song hasn't been released yet.

00:42:22.343 --> 00:42:24.896
I don't think they'll play it yet.

00:42:26.949 --> 00:42:28.104
That's a shame.

00:42:29.152 --> 00:42:31.347
Then on the day their new tape comes out,

00:42:31.371 --> 00:42:32.772
you go line up with me.

00:42:34.189 --> 00:42:35.234
Okay, bro.

00:42:36.875 --> 00:42:38.411
So cool.

00:42:41.854 --> 00:42:42.744
Hey.

00:42:42.930 --> 00:42:45.052
You have 2 tickets in your shirt pocket.

00:42:45.971 --> 00:42:47.753
If one is for you,

00:42:47.777 --> 00:42:49.191
then who is the other one for?

00:42:51.949 --> 00:42:53.615
It's a secret.

00:42:57.909 --> 00:42:59.601
Then I'll go practice first.

00:42:59.625 --> 00:43:00.674
Yeah, go ahead.

00:43:00.698 --> 00:43:02.066
Keep it safe, don't lose it.

00:43:16.303 --> 00:43:17.829
That's enough.

00:43:18.489 --> 00:43:20.015
I'm bored. Practicing without a bassist.

00:43:20.966 --> 00:43:22.012
I know, right?

00:43:22.196 --> 00:43:23.918
I don't really hear it when we play.

00:43:23.942 --> 00:43:26.629
But without the bass, it doesn't feel right.

00:43:28.055 --> 00:43:30.601
Where did Chai go?

00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:33.027
Do you know, Ek?

00:43:33.433 --> 00:43:34.993
I don't know either.

00:43:36.415 --> 00:43:37.801
So should we call it a day?

00:43:46.316 --> 00:43:47.438
Nut.

00:43:55.012 --> 00:43:56.429
Let's go to the concert.

00:43:59.184 --> 00:44:00.474
Lin.

00:44:00.666 --> 00:44:02.559
I really want to go to this concert.

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:05.620
But my dad really won't allow it.

00:44:06.668 --> 00:44:07.840
He will.

00:44:08.059 --> 00:44:09.893
Lin already asked your dad for you.

00:44:10.213 --> 00:44:12.526
No more excuses. Let's go together.

00:44:14.915 --> 00:44:16.009
You already asked my dad?

00:44:16.041 --> 00:44:17.063
Yeah.

00:44:17.088 --> 00:44:18.696
And what did he say?

00:44:18.721 --> 00:44:19.951
He gave permission.

00:44:21.888 --> 00:44:23.094
Really?

00:44:23.119 --> 00:44:24.301
Really.

00:44:25.029 --> 00:44:26.243
Let's go together.

00:44:29.229 --> 00:44:30.528
Were you about to say something?

00:44:33.331 --> 00:44:34.486
No.

00:44:34.945 --> 00:44:36.566
Then I'll go first.

00:44:37.148 --> 00:44:38.715
Let's go.

00:44:42.821 --> 00:44:45.261
Are you okay?

00:44:52.816 --> 00:44:54.270
Are you giving it to me?

00:44:55.533 --> 00:44:56.540
Yeah.

00:45:29.319 --> 00:45:31.545
Maybe this is for the best.

00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:35.182
The fact that we can change the future like this,

00:45:35.915 --> 00:45:37.475
that means

00:45:37.963 --> 00:45:40.209
in the end, Nut might be healthy.

00:45:40.819 --> 00:45:43.872
Get to spend time with Lin, as he should.

00:45:45.087 --> 00:45:47.669
Chai probably won't have to get into a fight and die.

00:45:48.413 --> 00:45:49.701
As for Phop,

00:45:49.726 --> 00:45:51.892
He probably got to listen to that song

00:45:51.916 --> 00:45:54.203
that he never got to listen to in his past life.

00:46:00.692 --> 00:46:03.625
♪ Please don't whine. ♪

00:46:06.794 --> 00:46:08.528
Thank heaven,

00:46:08.901 --> 00:46:10.307
or whatever,

00:46:10.978 --> 00:46:12.342
for letting me go back in time

00:46:12.366 --> 00:46:14.119
to make everything better like this.

00:46:32.387 --> 00:46:33.894
Thank you so much.

00:47:06.615 --> 00:47:07.980
(Next Episode)
From now on, Ek,

00:47:08.004 --> 00:47:10.207
don't get involved with Chai anymore.

00:47:10.231 --> 00:47:11.705
I'm worried.

00:47:12.308 --> 00:47:14.076
I'm Phop's younger brother.

00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:16.708
I'll be taking care of the shop for him for a while.

00:47:16.828 --> 00:47:18.611
I just got a new camera.

00:47:18.635 --> 00:47:20.269
Go be my model for some pictures.

00:47:20.364 --> 00:47:23.216
Next year, Lin is going to study in England.

00:47:23.350 --> 00:47:25.002
I was also thinking of sending Nut

00:47:25.026 --> 00:47:26.625
to study abroad.

00:47:26.911 --> 00:47:28.286
The future is really created

00:47:28.310 --> 00:47:30.171
by what we do in the present.

00:47:30.196 --> 00:47:32.590
Or is the future already determined?

00:47:32.656 --> 00:47:34.142
I've told you before, right?

00:47:34.167 --> 00:47:36.009
That I've time-traveled from the future.
