[The Journey of Legend]

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.950
[Episode 7]

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.110
I knew it.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.000
Yes.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.340
Bad news! Bad news!

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.130
The woodshed is on fire!

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.680
The woodshed is on fire?

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.350
Go, go, go!

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.870
Hurry!

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:54.479
Move!

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.310
Hurry!

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:57.400
Wait.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.840
It's a diversion.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.710
Let's go to Zhenmei Pavilion.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:03.240
Alright.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.040
[Zhenmei Pavilion]

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.560
Come on.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.920
What...

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.419
What's happening?

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:10.430
I have no idea.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.079
Stop!

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.420
Why did he suddenly kill himself?

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.800
What are you guys doing here?

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.280
I came to Miss Tang
to get my jade pendant back.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.070
I didn't expect to run into this.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.800
I saw him sneaking over here,

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:19.079
so I followed him.

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.010
Unexpectedly, as soon as he saw me,

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.340
he tried to kill me.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.640
Xilou, they must have been knocked out
by some kind of powder.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.860
Mr. Qiu has served the Xiao family
for so many years.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.430
I never thought he'd be a spy
for the Power Gang.

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:42.880
Let me ask you.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.290
What else did Mr. Qiu do today?

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:47.710
He usually cleaned the Sword Manor.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.770
Today, he just went to the woodshed

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.800
and helped Ms. Zhang water the flowers.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.190
The woodshed caught on fire just now.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.790
It was meant to lure us there.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.310
Father, Mother,
when he watered the flowers,

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.270
he actually went to administer poison.

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.330
Pass down my order:

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.360
no one in the Xiao Residence
is to draw water from the well.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.240
Go check

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.800
if the well has been poisoned.

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.870
Yes.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.300
There's only one well in the Sword Manor.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.480
Now that it's poisoned,

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.870
they mean to wipe us all out.

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.390
Oh no! I just had the servants draw water

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:46.190
to make soup

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.310
and deliver it to Zhenmei Pavilion.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.800
Youâ€¦

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:51.480
Let's go.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.800
Mr. Zhang.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.830
Mr. Xiao.

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:03.870
What has happened?

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.360
Someone poisoned the well.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.310
The soup that was just
brought here is poisonous.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:08.240
Mr. Xiao.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.560
Don't worry.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.270
I haven't touched that soup yet.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:26.560
In this case,

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.000
there's no need to keep it a secret.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.680
Go call everyone here.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.740
Everyone, this is Old Madam Wu.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.760
Greetings, Old Madam Wu.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.750
Greetings.

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.310
Please be seated.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.050
Thank you, Old Madam Wu.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.870
Old Madam Wu,

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.560
these are all heroes
who have stood with the Xiao family

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.680
against the Power Gang.

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:09.270
When I learned you were
all fighting the Power Gang out there,

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.750
I couldn't eat or sleep in peace.

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.360
I had no appetite for that soup,

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.780
so I luckily escaped being poisoned.

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:23.920
Old Madam Wu, why have you
come to the Sword Manor?

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.890
I was going to the Immortal Pass
to look for my son,

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.480
but while passing through Jinzhong,

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.190
I was stopped by a group of people
from the martial world.

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:35.190
They demanded that I hand over
the Hero Command Token.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.610
Thankfully, Mr. Xiao came to my rescue

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.740
and let me hide here.

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:43.740
Old Madam Wu,

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:46.240
there's something I don't understand,

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.440
and I'd like to ask you about it,
if I may.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:49.760
Please, go ahead.

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:52.610
Old Madam Wu,
you're not from the martial world.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.720
Why do those people believe
the Hero Command Token

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.680
is in your hands?

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:02.600
Thirteen years ago,

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.570
the Beihuang Army rampaged

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.800
and seized our lands by force.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.120
They marched into Daxi

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.390
and committed atrocities on our lands,

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.380
doing whatever they pleased.

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.190
People became homeless refugees.

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:19.390
Protect His Majesty!

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.270
The emperor was forced
to flee the capital.

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:25.630
Daxi was on the brink of ruin.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:33.120
At that time,

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:37.000
the leaders of Shaolin,
Wudang, and Emei Sects

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:39.340
gathered heroes from across the country

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.270
and forged the Hero Command Token

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:44.630
with a crystal from the stars.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.480
They also swore a blood oath:

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.270
whoever could save Daxi from destruction

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.950
would be awarded that token.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.070
And in the end,

00:07:54.409 --> 00:07:56.650
someone truly did.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:07:59.920
Crazy Yan?

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:01.230
That's right.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.560
Crazy Yan broke into
the Beihuang Army's camp,

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:07.120
killed 37 elite guards,

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:10.290
and nearly took
the enemy commander's life.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.320
So Crazy Yan got the Hero Command Token.

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:35.909
But he was too arrogant,

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:37.809
shunned by the martial world.

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:40.960
After being besieged at Wuxing Mountain,

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:43.510
he vanished without a traceâ€”

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.390
until recently,

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:51.120
when he sent the token to me via a falcon.

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:55.910
So the Hero Command Token

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:57.840
was entrusted to you

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:00.360
by Crazy Yan on purpose.

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:01.630
Exactly.

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:05.510
The Power Gang

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:09.670
somehow learned that I had the token

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:12.440
and began hunting me down,

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:16.840
hurting innocents along the way
and causing needless bloodshed.

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:20.600
Mr. Xiao.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.960
What's the situation outside now?

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:28.670
The Power Gang has indeed
sent many men this time,

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:31.960
but the Sword Manor is well defended.

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:34.050
They won't be able to break in.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.000
However...

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:41.290
Please, speak freely.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:47.000
They've poisoned the only well

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.790
in the Sword Manor.

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:53.720
We'll run out of the remaining water soon.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:00.000
Once again, I've put everyone in danger.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.670
I feel terrible about this.

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:04.390
Old Madam Wu, you mustn't say that.

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:07.600
General Wu has served the country
with absolute loyalty.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.440
He is a hero to us all.

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:13.600
Throughout all of Daxi,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.630
only General Wu is
worthy of the Hero Command Token.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.000
This time,

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:20.960
it's truly

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.720
the Xiao family's honor

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.530
to escort you, Old Madam Wu.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.270
If those villains were to kidnap you

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:32.960
and distract General Wu,

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:35.120
causing him to miss opportunities
on the front lines,

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.150
the Northern Wastelanders

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:38.480
would take advantage of it
and attack again.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:42.670
Then we'd become sinners of the country.

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:47.550
Mr. Xiao,

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:51.080
what's your plan now? Just tell me.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.480
I trust the Xiao family completely.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.360
The Power Gang poisoned the well.

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:59.790
Their goal is to force us out.

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:01.910
Outside the Sword Manor,

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:05.750
there must be countless traps
waiting for us.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.320
But by agreement,

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:08.480
in 2 days,

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:10.790
we must escort Old Madam Wu

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:12.840
to meet with General Wu.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.480
This cannot be delayed,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.870
nor can we sit here waiting for death.

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:35.150
Father,

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.100
if some of us leave the Sword Manor first,

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:41.080
how long will the remaining water last?

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.720
If some of us can get out,

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:45.280
the remaining water

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.480
is enough for 20 days.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:53.720
Twenty daysâ€¦

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.010
Alright,

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.000
I understand.

00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:59.150
Everyone,

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:01.510
we still need to escort Old Madam Wu

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:03.480
to meet General Wu on time.

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:04.790
Only by doing this

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.390
can we break this deadlock

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.080
and gain time

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:11.480
for help from the other sects.

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:13.150
Only by working together

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:14.680
can we defeat the Power Gang

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.030
and lift the siege on the Xiao family.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.300
But weapons show no mercy,

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:21.240
and the Power Gang is ruthless.

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:23.490
If we send Old Madam Wu out rashly,

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:26.150
wouldn't that risk her life?

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:28.810
Besides, in the martial world today,

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.890
how many people dare
to stand against the Power Gang?

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.450
Your plan is nothing

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.240
but wishful thinking.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.720
We just fought
the Power Gang in the Sword Manor.

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.240
Have you already forgotten?

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.960
No matter how powerful the Power Gang is,

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:44.080
can they overpower
the entire martial world?

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:47.210
Moreover, everyone here
stands against the Power Gang.

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:49.120
Old Madam Wu,

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.400
please rest assured. I will do my utmost

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:53.410
to ensure your safety.

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:58.630
I've heard Huishan
speak of this boy before.

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:01.750
He truly takes after
you and your wife the most.

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:04.510
Qiushui is right.

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:05.840
It's time for us

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.370
to discuss how to break out.

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:11.160
But the Power Gang
has surrounded the Sword Manor.

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:13.550
They'll surely be watching closely.

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:16.080
We cannot guarantee
everyone's safe escape.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.730
Indeed. Forcing our way out
would only result in heavy casualties.

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:23.360
Besides, our only advantage now

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:25.390
is knowing their target

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:26.390
is Old Madam Wu.

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:31.120
Why don't we come up with a clever plan

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:32.200
to trick them?

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:36.550
We can have someone

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:37.950
impersonate Old Madam Wu

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:39.030
as a decoy

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:41.290
to distract the enemy.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:47.670
To ensure Old Madam Wu's safe escape,

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:49.550
some of us must

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:51.600
divert the enemy's attention.

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:53.610
Then it's settled.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.960
The rest of us will do everything possible

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:59.670
to ensure Old Madam Wu gets out safely.

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:03.790
But if someone must serve as a decoy

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:06.120
just so I can leave,

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:09.150
I'd feel terrible about it.

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:11.910
Old Madam Wu, don't worry.

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:13.310
I'll draw them away.

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:15.960
Qiushui.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.160
Mother, don't worry.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.440
Yiren and the others are not around,

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.840
and I'm grown now.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.270
It's time I do my part
for the Huanhua Sect.

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:15.600
Everyone, the Power Gang
has committed countless crimes.

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.670
Rather than waiting for death,

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.620
we might as well take the risk,

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.080
fight our way out,

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:24.190
get help from the martial world,

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.840
and destroy the gang!

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.120
Yes!

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.240
Xilou, you're injured,

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:33.250
so just stay here
in the Sword Manor this time.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.090
The rest of us

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:35.790
will help Old Madam Wu,

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:37.890
Qiushui, and the others break out.

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:45.630
Everyone,
this journey is fraught with danger.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.150
Please take care of yourselves.

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:50.520
I'll be waiting for your return

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:52.790
to share wine and tea with you.

00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:56.310
-Rest assured, Xilou.
-Rest assured, Mr. Xiao.

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:11.790
Qiushui.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:15.170
Mother.

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:19.440
There are many skilled fighters
outside the Sword Manor.

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:20.970
You must protect yourself.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.320
Shan, don't worry.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.600
Our son has grown up.

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.870
Since he has chosen
to take on this responsibility,

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:33.240
he must have thought it through.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.910
Trust his judgment.

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:38.270
Children of the Xiao family

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:41.870
don't make empty promises
without confidence.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.270
Father, Mother.

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:48.550
I haven't spent much time with you
since I came back this time.

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:49.280
Don't worry.

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.260
I'll take good care of myself.

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:52.910
Besides, Mother,

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:56.080
I haven't had enough of your noodles yet.

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:03.510
Take this.

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:07.440
Besides the Three Styles of Boldness,

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:09.200
I also have this treasure bag.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.859
It contains many mechanisms.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.960
You must keep in mind how to use them.

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:15.640
Use them in the most devious way possible.

00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:22.030
Yes, your mother is right.

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:25.310
Even I onceâ€¦

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:26.569
fell for her tricks.

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:32.150
Neat trick. Neat trick.

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:34.680
Qiushui.

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.450
Earlier when we were drinking,

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:42.070
you said you've always
admired those swordsmen

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:45.480
who punish evil
and defend the weak with their swords.

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.070
But, son,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.600
have you thought about this?

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.240
Everyone is made of flesh and blood,

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.490
naturally afraid of death.

00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:58.270
So why, when it's about justice,

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.790
do those people no longer fear death?

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:07.480
It's because in this world,

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:11.830
there are things
more important than life itself.

00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:14.640
Today,

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:18.920
so many friends are willing
to fight for our Xiao family,

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.440
risking injury or death.

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:24.480
Never forget their kindness.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:28.480
Father, Mother,

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:31.610
I'll keep it in mind.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.550
Once Old Madam Wu is safe,

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.310
I will seek help
from all sects in Jinzhong.

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:40.030
Together we'll defeat the Power Gang.

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:46.830
Go now.

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:55.640
Take care. Take care of yourself.

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:04.400
Father, Mother.

00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:06.510
Within 20 days,

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:09.490
I will seek help from all sects

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:11.960
and return to save the Sword Manor.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.600
Take care of yourselves.

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:24.900
â™ª Huanhua flower withers â™ª

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:29.630
â™ª What's the meaning of my life? â™ª

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:32.240
â™ª The wind blows â™ª

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:36.710
â™ª Like a farewell song â™ª

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:39.760
â™ª Who accompanies when the qin breaks? â™ª

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:42.250
â™ª How much sadness is there? â™ª

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:45.380
â™ª Gazing at the moon
at the end of the world â™ª

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:53.440
â™ª Tears fall unrestrained;
the leaves are unswayed â™ª

00:19:56.650 --> 00:19:58.400
â™ª The moon is reflected in the water â™ª

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:02.660
â™ª Not even a ripple is left behind â™ª

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:06.790
â™ª The broken sword can't be pulled out â™ª

00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:10.930
â™ª It's a heartbreaking punishment â™ª

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.380
â™ª Huanhua flower withers â™ª

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:18.150
â™ª What's the meaning of my life? â™ª

00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:20.540
â™ª The wind blows â™ª

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:26.220
â™ª Like a farewell song â™ª

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:28.080
â™ª Who accompanies when the qin breaks? â™ª

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:28.350
â™ª How much sadness is there? â™ª

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:30.770
Shan, it's alright.

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:32.910
â™ª Gazing at the moon
at the end of the world â™ª

00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:34.550
Our son has grown up and become reliable.

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:36.480
â™ª Tears fall unrestrained;
the leaves are unswayed â™ª

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.200
Look,

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.350
he has so manyâ€¦

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:44.560
brave and loyal friends.

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.530
â™ª Who accompanies when the qin breaks? â™ª

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:46.940
We should feel at ease

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:49.280
â™ª How much sadness is there? â™ª

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:50.310
â™ª Gazing at the moon
at the end of the world â™ª

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:52.840
letting him make his way
in the martial world.

00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:53.790
â™ª Tears fall unrestrained;
the leaves are unswayed â™ª

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:54.880
Alright.

00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:00.470
I want one more look at him.

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:09.040
â™ª As the flowers fall,
my heart falls with them â™ª

00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:21.830
Kill.

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:33.510
After breaking out of the Sword Manor,

00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:34.910
we'll split into 4 teams.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.900
Uncle Qu, Uncle Meng, and Uncle Tieyi

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:38.640
will lead the Dragon Team
to draw their fire,

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:41.040
giving the other 3 teams
a chance to escape.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.930
Old Madam Wu will hide her identity
with a black veil.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.790
Others will wear black robes

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.750
and split into 3 groups to escort her,

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:49.790
confusing the enemy

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:51.320
and dividing their forces.

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:52.790
Let's go!

00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:11.150
[Let them go.]

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:12.770
[Take them down one by one.]

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:27.840
Buy as much time as possible.

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:28.900
Don't get exposed.

00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:32.200
Give Old Madam Wu's team more time.

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:41.140
This way.

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:56.680
Tang Fang, Feng Lang,

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.830
you'll protect Old Madam Wu
with the Phoenix Team

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:00.260
and break through from the eastern woods.

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:00.910
Remember,

00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:02.380
keep your gas masks on.

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:04.180
You'll pass through
a forest with toxic miasma,

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:06.180
which will slow down the Power Gang.

00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:06.800
Besides,

00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:08.450
they're likely to believe Old Madam Wu

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:09.930
would stay with Mr. Zhang.

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:11.600
You'll be safer this way.

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.370
The miasma forest is ahead.

00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:16.300
Put on the masks.

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:32.280
Let's go.

00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:43.770
Uncle Kang and I will lure

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:46.190
the Power Gang deeper into the forest.

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:47.510
They're catching up!

00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:48.550
Go ahead with Old Madam Wu.

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:49.240
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:26.030
[In this case,]

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:28.510
[I'll lure all of you here.]

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:39.980
Go!

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:46.210
Tang Rou, Yuhan, Zuoqiu,

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:47.280
proceed with caution

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:48.960
and find a chance to head up the mountain.

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.510
The Power Gang won't expect anyone

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:52.310
to go in the opposite direction.

00:24:58.030 --> 00:24:58.590
Go.

00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:16.970
Leave Old Madam Wu behind,

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:18.730
and I'll spare your lives.

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:25.440
It's you.

00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:27.520
One word for you:

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:28.880
stupid.

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:32.030
How dare you fool me? I'll kill you.

00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:33.510
I doubt it.

00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:35.320
Attack!

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:25.750
No!

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:34.220
G-Go.

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:36.960
Go!

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:38.640
Go.

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:40.680
Go!

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:45.030
Brothers,

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.350
stop fighting!

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:51.680
Let's go!

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:53.510
Let's go.

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:54.830
Let's go.

00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:56.480
Third Young Master, go!

00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:57.940
Let's go together!

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:01.590
Come on, get up!

00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:06.640
The Xiao family once protected me.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.920
Today, I'm repaying that debt.

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:11.310
Stop talking and go!

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:12.960
Go!

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.200
Third Young Master, go!

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:38.200
Kong Yangqin!

00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:42.600
You're nothing compared to Fu Tianyi.

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:46.030
You can't kill me.

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:48.920
You can't kill me!

00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:25.320
This thing from Xiao Qiushui
is quite useful.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:27.860
What are these?

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:30.690
They protect you from the miasma.
Take them.

00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:32.940
One each. Safety first. Put them on.

00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:45.790
Protect Old Madam Wu.

00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:46.450
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:40.500
The target isn't here. Retreat.

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:51.890
What's going on?

00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:52.790
Where is Old Madam Wu?

00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:53.790
I don't know either.

00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:56.390
Third Young Master asked me
to dress like this.

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:57.370
Father, Mother,

00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:59.230
although Mr. Qiu is dead,

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:01.440
the Power Gang has always been cunning,

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:03.550
with spies everywhere
and endless schemes.

00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:05.210
To ensure nothing goes wrong,

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:07.350
I have to change the plan
at the last minute

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:08.350
to throw them off.

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:13.830
You'll disguise yourself as Old Madam Wu
and leave with Feng Lang.

00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:15.230
Should I inform Mr. Feng?

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:16.230
No need.

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:17.130
Understood.

00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:20.570
Then what about the real Old Madam Wu?

00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:23.850
Mother, I have another plan for her.

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:27.710
Why did Xiao Qiushui
suddenly change the plan?

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:30.200
Where is Old Madam Wu?

00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:33.780
Find Xiao Qiushui, and we'll know.

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:42.140
Hurry back to the Sword Manor.

00:30:49.210 --> 00:30:52.420
Why on earth did you come
to the Xiao Residence?

00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:54.910
Xiao Qiushui once helped me.

00:30:55.790 --> 00:30:57.030
It's only right that I help him

00:30:57.030 --> 00:30:58.090
fight his enemies.

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:00.640
But since you came out,

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:03.750
you don't seem
all that concerned about his safety.

00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:04.680
Compared to him,

00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:07.720
you care more
about Madam Wu's whereabouts.

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:09.800
That doesn't seem right.

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:12.750
Miss Tang,

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:15.310
are you making such assumptions

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:17.570
because you came with ulterior motives?

00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:25.070
Then why did you save me just now?

00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:28.050
It was nothing. No particular reason.

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:54.680
Keep running.

00:31:55.550 --> 00:31:56.950
Why did you stop running?

00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:01.660
I'll break your bones

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:05.280
and make them into plectrums for my qin.
What do you think?

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:06.590
Fine.

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:09.440
I won't run anymore.

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:13.210
You're afraid to die, aren't you?

00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:15.880
Not really.

00:32:18.490 --> 00:32:20.020
I'll send you to your death.

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:23.640
Kill him.

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:24.720
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:22.040
You slaughtered disciples
of the Xiao family.

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:24.230
Take your qin

00:33:25.030 --> 00:33:26.710
and play it on your way to hell.

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:41.350
This little trick of yours

00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:43.310
will only cost you your life.

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:46.640
It's just the appetizer.

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:48.870
Tell me where Old Madam Wu is.

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:49.920
Or else

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:52.400
I'll feed you to my venomous bugs.

00:33:54.530 --> 00:33:56.260
[Hua Gufen, the Poison Demon,]

00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:58.740
[this place will be where you die.]

00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:37.710
Tang Rou,

00:34:38.590 --> 00:34:41.520
you're skilled
with hidden weapons and mechanisms.

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:43.909
This time, I need you to do me a favor.

00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:47.199
Fine. What do you want me to do?

00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:52.400
Big Brother, your recent actions

00:34:52.670 --> 00:34:54.730
have been rather hard to understand.

00:34:55.449 --> 00:34:56.090
Am I right?

00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:01.190
[Fu Tianyi is dead,
and the Xiao family is besieged.]

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.260
[Who knows where the story will go next?]

00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:07.030
[I'd better take precautions.]

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:18.690
Are you alright?

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:23.630
I'm fine.

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:38.440
What about the other guards?

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.460
Y-You've been poisoned
by Hua Gufen's bugs.

00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:03.650
Let me treat you.

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:05.880
No need.

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:11.150
Xueyu gave me some detoxifying pills.

00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:14.490
I'll just take one later.

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:19.550
What about Old Madam Wu and Tang Rou?

00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:21.490
Old Madam Wu and the others

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:23.590
should be safe now.

00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:24.590
Tang Rou,

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.590
take Old Madam Wu and Mr. Zhang

00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:27.960
to the cliff at the back of the mountain

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:29.160
and leave from there.

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:31.880
How are we supposed to cross that cliff?

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:33.360
Don't worry. I have a way.

00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:46.340
This device from Qiushui is amazing.

00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:47.470
It can actually fly.

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:51.050
Old Madam Wu.

00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:53.570
Old Madam Wu,

00:36:53.590 --> 00:36:54.520
are you alright?

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:56.320
I am fine.

00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:58.900
Mr. Xiao's plan is brilliant.

00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:01.160
Let's take Old Madam Wu
to take a rest now.

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:02.920
Okay.

00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:08.030
I'm glad Old Madam Wu is safe.

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:09.210
But Mr. Xiao,

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:12.760
why did you change the plan
at the last minute?

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:15.680
In the martial world,

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:19.830
the Power Gang's spies are everywhere.

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:22.020
Their identities are hidden,

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.770
and they're too cunning to guard against.

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:28.590
I couldn't risk Old Madam Wu's life,

00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:32.430
so I changed the plan at the last moment.

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:44.480
It seems my parents

00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:46.960
and uncles

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:49.290
have safely retreated to the Sword Manor.

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:53.020
It's getting late.

00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:56.000
We need to join General Wu's troops

00:37:56.510 --> 00:37:57.640
as soon as possible.

00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:58.450
Let's go.

00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:16.430
Greetings, Red Phoenix.

00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:18.510
You work for the Sword King?

00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:19.110
Yes.

00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:22.670
Who allowed you
to meddle in Master's affairs?

00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:24.630
Have you seen where Old Madam Wu went?

00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:26.760
My master only ordered us
to watch the Xiao family.

00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:27.880
We never went inside.

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:30.140
How would we know
where Old Madam Wu went?

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:32.280
I see.

00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:54.370
[The Sword King's men are
also looking for Old Madam Wu.]

00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:56.100
[I must report this to Master.]

00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:30.150
These places

00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:32.590
have all been infiltrated
by the Power Gang.

00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:33.940
After Old Madam Wu arrives,

00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:35.070
she'll need to rest.

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:40.760
Tang Fang, go wait outside town.

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:42.670
If you meet Old Madam Wu,

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:44.340
give her a heads-up first.

00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:46.910
I'll go to Tongfu Inn

00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:48.940
to check out the situation there.

00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:50.900
Alright, be careful.

00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:04.790
[Tongfu Inn]

00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:06.790
Sirs, will you be dining or staying?

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:10.700
Have the people from the west arrived?

00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:11.650
You areâ€¦

00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:19.760
No one has come,

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:22.090
but there's a letter
I was told to deliver.

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:24.870
[To Xiao Xilou]

00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:35.210
[Lingliang Town is
crawling with the Power Gang's men.]

00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:35.490
[Old Madam Wu is unsafe there.]

00:40:35.490 --> 00:40:35.770
[Wait for our smoke signal
in the Shili Forest in the southwest.]

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:36.480
[We'll pick Old Madam Wu up.
â€”The Wu family's guards.]

00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:45.880
Thanks.

00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:54.160
Tomorrow afternoon,

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:56.280
we'll meet at a different location.

00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:59.800
Do Old Madam Wu and the others
know the new place?

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:00.730
They should have

00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:03.660
another way
to pass the message along.

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:07.560
No time to waste.

00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:09.080
Let's go.

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:10.880
Make way! Make way! Make way!

00:41:15.110 --> 00:41:15.910
Any findings?

00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:16.670
No.

00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:18.320
Guard every exit of the town.
