00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.240
Do you know that spirit?

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.000
It's none of your business.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.880
You literally said,

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.040
"He's not the Khemmika you knew."

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.280
You talked about me, didn't you?

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.340
See that sign over there?

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.000
It used to be a viewpoint.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.740
How about we pitch a tent
and do some stargazing tonight?

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.520
I've got a long-range rifle, baby!

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.160
Hey, are you done yet?

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.940
Jet,

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.920
help Uncle Chai
gather the entire village.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.440
We'll form search groups
to look for Te, Korn, and Phu.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.560
They must be found before noon.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.160
Why before noon?

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.120
If they're not found by noon,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.160
we're looking for bodies.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.320
You may rise.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.320
You came because of
those three boys, didn't you?

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:39.540
I fully understand

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.920
that the three of them
have offended you.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.080
I will make them pay
for what they've done.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.280
All I ask is that

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.840
you let them go

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.120
and let them live.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.400
I never wanted those impure souls.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.320
It was someone else who caused this,

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:04.880
not me.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.160
What do you mean?

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.200
Lord of the Mountains, Phuchong,

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.640
we've done everything,
but she wouldn't regain her senses.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:19.960
Hold her tight.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.120
There's an intruder in my forest.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.040
I assume this has something
to do with you.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.320
Little boy, please wake up
and help Khem.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.680
Please.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.240
Little boy...

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:08.320
Khem!

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.400
Khem...

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:17.280
Khem!

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:18.840
Khem!

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:24.800
Khem...

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.720
Khem!

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.480
Khem!

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.000
I'll have the nymphs release them,

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.920
but only if they enter monkhood,
cast off desire for at least six years,

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.960
and observe the Eight Precepts for life.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.760
Should they fail,

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.280
they shall be summoned back here,
cursed to roam this forest,

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.240
never to reincarnate again.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.120
I am deeply grateful.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.080
Phuchong is my name.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.040
One more soul
has strayed into this forest.

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.320
I can only help those three.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.560
As for the other one,

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.919
you'll have to find a way on your own.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.120
The other one?

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.720
Who are you referring to?

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.400
We're in trouble, Master.

00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:58.060
It's Khem.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.680
He's disappeared, Master.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.040
You need to help him!

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:03.760
Please.

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:06.480
It's my fault, too.
I shouldn't have taken my eyes off him.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.000
I'm begging you, too.

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:10.880
Please help him.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:12.480
Please.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.560
I never said I'd refuse.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.320
You all will stay here.

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:19.840
Don't let the flame die.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.040
If I'm not back in an hour,

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.840
light a stick of incense to summon me.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.520
Khem!

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.600
A letter for you, Khem.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:38.080
[Notification of Killed in Action
and Posthumous Commendation]

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:42.920
No...

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:44.720
It can't be.

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.800
Calm down, Khem.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.680
He wasn't supposed to die like this.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.960
He can't just leave me.

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:57.440
No...

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.480
He would never leave me.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.280
Khem!

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:09.920
Are you okay, Khem?

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.800
Breathe slowly, okay?

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.440
Take it easy.

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:21.720
Khem...

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.480
Help! Khem needs help!

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:28.040
Khem!

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.520
Khem!

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.200
Khem...

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:37.480
Khem!

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:39.960
Please marry me.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.000
I'm sorry,

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:47.720
but my love is for Wat.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.240
Even if he never comes back,

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:51.920
I'll keep waiting for him.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.680
If anything happens to her
while I'm gone,

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:58.600
you're in big trouble.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.440
Khem and I...

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.680
We're engaged, Mom!

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.400
Thank you. You're...

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:22.960
Pawat.

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:24.880
I'm Pawat Wongpradit.

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:26.520
Pawat...

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.760
That's a beautiful name.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.600
I'm Khem,

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:38.560
Khemmika.

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.880
You remember everything now, don't you?

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.240
You are...

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:03.800
Mr. Chayod,

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:06.280
aren't you?

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.040
Just call me Yod like you used to.

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.320
I haven't changed,

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.520
and you're still my Khemmika.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:18.880
But...

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.280
Mr. Chayod,

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:25.080
your Khemmika

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.200
is gone.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.120
But you remember me now.

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:34.200
Let me take care of you
just like I promised to.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.160
Please, Khem.

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:39.720
Come stay here with me.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.760
Let's stay here together.

00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:58.920
I can't.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.200
If I stay here,

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:07.040
that means I'm dead.

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:10.680
No, Khem.

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:12.760
Trust me.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.280
Everything will just go back
to the way it was.

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.400
Step back.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.360
Please just let me go.

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.560
How long will you keep rejecting me?

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.240
When will I matter to you?

00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:54.750
Argh!

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:58.920
Run, sweetie!

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:21.760
Mom...

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.800
I've been watching over you all along.

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.840
Every day, I wished
I could show myself to you.

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.520
I'm sorry...

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:55.560
I wasn't able to do that until now.

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.080
It's totally okay.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.720
I always knew

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:06.800
you'd come for me.

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.080
Are you doing okay, Mom?

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:30.800
Don't be scared.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.880
I'll take you out of here.

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:19.360
Come on.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:20.800
Let's go back to Master.

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:23.240
Think you're leaving this place?

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:23.920
Mom!

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:26.520
Khem!

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.000
Khem!

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:33.080
You know I own this place.

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.480
- Khem!
- Did you actually think I wouldn't know

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:36.120
- Khem!
- where you were hiding?

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.040
Khem!

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.320
Mr. Chayod,

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:40.480
let him go.

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.420
Please don't hurt him.

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:45.160
Just take it out on me!

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.200
Mom...

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:47.200
Mom!

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.640
I have cherished and protected you

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.560
for over 80 years.

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.760
How could I let you be taken
by someone else so easily?

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:09.040
Leave me alone.

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:10.840
(Incanting)

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.260
Go away!

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:15.520
(Incanting)

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:17.600
You have no idea how much I loved her.

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:19.480
(Incanting)

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:22.520
And how much it hurt
to watch her suffer because of you.

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:24.360
(Incanting)

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.440
You left her in your last life.

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:27.960
(Incanting)

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
And you don't love him in this one.

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.640
(Incanting)

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.480
Why the hell are you standing in my way?

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:37.080
(Incanting)

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:45.880
You didn't love him.

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:48.560
You've only loved yourself.

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:50.680
Look at that face.

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.480
Look at the face
of the one you claim to love.

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.080
I told you to look at that face!

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:12.640
Should this be
the face of someone you love,

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.480
someone you want to protect?

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:19.040
Is this how you want him to be?

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:24.400
If your love were real,

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.480
you wouldn't want this to happen.

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:37.920
Khem!

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.680
Khem, hang in there.

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:44.400
Master...

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:45.880
Master,

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:47.510
it's been an hour.

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:49.680
Come with me.

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:05.840
Get the pot.

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.000
Here you go.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:20.520
Close it with a talisman.

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.040
A talisman!

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:29.280
Seal the pot!

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:38.560
Where's Khem, though?

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:40.840
Follow me.

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:45.160
Both of you.

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:51.760
Khem!

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:52.440
Khem...

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:54.280
Khem!

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:55.480
Khem, where are you?

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:56.680
Khem!

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.880
- Khem...
- Khem!

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:03.520
You're Charn, right?

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:05.390
Yes.

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:07.640
- Khem!
- Khem!

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:15.680
Your instincts are strong.

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.000
Focus your mind on Khem,

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:20.840
and follow wherever your gut leads you.

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:23.560
Me?

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.200
Yeah.

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:29.680
Just give it a shot.

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.040
This way!

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:53.600
Khem!

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:54.780
Khem...

00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:55.720
Khem!

00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:58.280
Hang in there, Khem.

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:00.280
We're coming.

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:02.180
Khem!

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:08.360
Khem.

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:09.560
Khem!

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.080
Please show yourself.

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:12.560
Khem...

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:14.280
Khem!

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:15.400
Khem!

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:17.560
- Khem...
- Show yourself, please.

00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:23.460
- Khem...
- Where are you?

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:27.960
- Come to us, Khem.
- Khem!

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:30.080
- Khem!
- Khem.

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.200
- Khem...
- Khem!

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:35.040
- Khem!
- Stop.

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:55.320
(Incanting)

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:10.680
- Khem!
- Khem...

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:15.120
Khem...

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:16.200
- Khem!
- Khem...

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:17.640
Leave it.

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:20.760
I'll take him.

00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:30.160
Take this.

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:33.160
Okay.

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:35.000
Yod!

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:43.600
It was you, wasn't it?

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:48.720
I'm sorry.

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.400
How could you do such a thing?

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:01.560
I'm your brother!

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:05.160
And Khem was your friend.

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:08.840
How could you kill her?

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:11.880
How could you?!

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:15.040
I didn't mean to.

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:17.360
I'm sorry.

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:23.080
I just wanted her to let go of you.

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:25.920
By doing something this evil?

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:28.320
You forged the paper.

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:31.520
You're going to jail for this!

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:40.040
I'm sorry, Wat.

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:43.360
I was a fool.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.520
Couldn't think straight.

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:50.800
I just knew I loved her.

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:57.040
I really did, Wat.

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:01.140
Please forgive me.

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:03.160
Please...

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:13.640
Forgive me, Wat.

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:30.480
Our parents' inheritance...

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.200
and everything I have...

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:38.360
It's all yours.

00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:43.280
From now on,

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:46.040
we're no longer family.

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:54.080
Now leave.

00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:58.680
Get out of here!

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:06.160
I said, "Get out!"

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:19.760
I'm sorry, honey.

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.480
I'm sorry...

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:25.320
I wasn't strong enough.

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:27.520
I should've waited longer for you.

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:40.920
Wat,

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.120
I'm sorry.

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:51.960
I'm really sorry.

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:30.160
Hold me if you want.

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:36.640
Let your tears fall if they must.

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:44.510
But never forget that I'm not Pawat

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.440
and that you're not Khemmika.

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:01.360
The past is in the past.

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:11.760
Right now, we're just two people
who have met by chance.

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:41.440
Master,

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:48.920
can you please stay with me for now?

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:57.840
At least until I fall asleep.

00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:58.440
How will you sleep
staring at me like that?

00:34:13.239 --> 00:34:14.320
Can I...

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:20.560
hold your hand, please?

00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:54.480
Just this once.

00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:00.680
Next time, I won't go easy on you.

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:10.490
Te!

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:16.600
- Found them?
- Hey...

00:36:16.770 --> 00:36:17.650
Mister!

00:36:17.770 --> 00:36:19.840
We couldn't find any of them.

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:21.640
Right, we didn't see them.

00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:22.810
- Did you search everywhere?
- Found them?

00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:23.810
Yes, mister.

00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:26.330
Let's keep going.

00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:27.490
- Come on, follow him.
- Go.

00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:28.330
Let's go.

00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:30.330
Korn!

00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:31.370
Te, Korn!

00:36:31.410 --> 00:36:32.530
- Where are you?
- Phu!

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:34.250
- Te!
- Where are you?

00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:35.810
Where are you?

00:36:35.850 --> 00:36:37.970
Te, Korn, Phu!

00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:39.530
- Where are you guys?
- Mister! Mister...

00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:42.250
- What?
- We haven't found any of them.

00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:45.450
Where are they?

00:36:46.210 --> 00:36:47.010
Guys,

00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:48.610
we need to find them.

00:36:49.330 --> 00:36:50.890
Hey, you go that way.

00:36:51.450 --> 00:36:52.410
All of you.

00:36:52.450 --> 00:36:53.760
- Search everywhere.
- Let's go, guys.

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:54.850
- Let's go this way.
- Te!

00:36:54.890 --> 00:36:55.690
Alright, mister.

00:36:55.850 --> 00:36:57.850
- Korn!
- Where are you?

00:36:58.090 --> 00:36:59.290
- Follow me.
- Korn, Phu!

00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:00.530
- Okay.
- Let's go.

00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:02.090
Let's go this way.

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:03.570
Phu!

00:37:03.810 --> 00:37:04.950
Te, Korn, Phu!

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:05.800
Where are you?

00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:07.130
It's already 4:45 A.M.

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:08.560
Do it.

00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:10.330
Will it really work?

00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:13.480
It did last time.

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:16.560
My master said you sense things well.

00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:18.930
But...

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:21.880
they don't really get along with me.

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:24.040
Will it really work?

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:26.360
Just do it.

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:27.880
You'll never know if you don't.

00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:34.230
Te, Korn,

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:35.720
Phu!

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:36.920
Show yourselves.

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:38.680
Come out already.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.600
You're causing trouble for everyone.

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:05.800
That way, Jet!

00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:07.840
- Let's go.
- Go.

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:51.400
Move, move.

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:52.200
Right here.

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:53.520
- Watch that.
- Careful.

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:55.280
Get him in there.

00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:00.160
Hey,

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:01.800
lucky for them

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:03.800
that the forest guardian let them out.

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:05.880
Alright,

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:07.160
you should get some rest.

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:10.160
I'm taking these guys to the hospital.

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:11.520
Thanks, Uncle.

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:12.880
Yeah.

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:14.200
- Let's go.
- Go.

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:15.760
- Hold them tight.
- Okay.

00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:25.200
Don't fall asleep.

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:27.600
Hang in there.

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:35.640
Ask me anything you want.

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:38.360
I know you've been dying to know
since last night.

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:40.280
You're right.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.640
I've got a lot of questions.

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:44.560
But...

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:46.600
you should go rest.

00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:48.400
You've had the hardest time.

00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:01.480
I'm getting some sleep, too.

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:05.080
When we've got our energy back,

00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:07.480
let's have a meal together.

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:09.320
Khem can join us, too.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.680
So it's you who has been
stirring chaos in my forest.

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:26.280
I merely came to tend to my own affairs.

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:33.360
I meant you no offense, Lord.

00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:35.960
Then...

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:38.840
what brings you here,
to provoke me in my own domain?

00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:53.640
You may stay if you wish,

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:58.840
but I forbid you from laying a finger
on the souls bound to my forest.

00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:01.920
Then, by the same token,

00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:05.240
I ask that you

00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:08.600
keep clear of the karma I must bear.

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:13.080
From this moment on,

00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:18.160
do not lend aid to any vile souls
who dare stand in my way.

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:22.440
- Or else...
- What could a lesser spirit do to me?

00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:26.120
Begone from my cave

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:27.280
at once!

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:12.960
Wat...

00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:22.640
I'm sorry,

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:24.800
Master.

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:28.280
Have you...

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:32.360
been sitting here all night?

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:39.280
Yeah.

00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:45.480
Didn't want to wake you up
by moving my finger.

00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:54.800
No need to smile.

00:43:58.320 --> 00:43:59.320
I'm annoyed.

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:02.600
I didn't do it willingly.

00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:07.480
Being harsh again.

00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:15.280
Go wash up and get dressed.

00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:18.520
Then come with me.

00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:20.760
Uh...

00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:23.240
- Will you have breakfast now...
- No.

00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:29.280
You and I have things to deal with.

00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:38.080
Tell me

00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:41.080
how you followed Khem into this life.

00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:33.040
When I decided to leave this world,

00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:39.280
I prayed with all my heart.

00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:40.280
[I can no longer bear the sins]

00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:41.600
Should there be a next life...
[I have hurt the ones I love...]

00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:42.920
[I offer my life as penance.
Please forgive me... From Chayod]

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:45.280
Let me see Khem again.

00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:53.080
Before my new life began,

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.160
I encountered her soul.

00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:08.920
And I found that malevolent spirit,

00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:13.720
who had long bound herself to her.

00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:32.640
At last,

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:35.480
you've come to me.

00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:42.280
You were torn apart
from your love in this life.

00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:46.320
In the next one,

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.600
what fate shall you face?

00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:52.280
Let me go.

00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:53.800
Who are you?

00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:57.960
Why are you messing with me?

00:47:58.400 --> 00:47:59.760
Don't you remember me,

00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:04.440
Krongkwan?

00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:07.040
Krongkwan?

00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:09.600
Who are you talking about?

00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:14.400
Let me go.

00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:16.480
What did I do to you?

00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:19.080
You turned me into this!

00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:23.560
Let her soul go.

00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:31.000
I told you to let her go.

00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:34.600
Khem...

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.200
Leave me alone!

00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:44.120
How could you do that, Yod?

00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:46.760
How?

00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:52.080
How could you do that?

00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:56.920
Do you understand me now?

00:48:58.200 --> 00:48:59.400
How does it feel

00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:02.840
to be torn away
from your beloved by another?

00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:11.400
Still...

00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:14.320
thanks to you,

00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:17.520
I didn't have to lift a finger.

00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:21.280
It's a pity, though,

00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:25.640
that you chose to take your own life.

00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:28.520
Don't you know that it's sinful?

00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:34.840
You may not be born a human
in your next life.

00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:37.880
Or...

00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:41.680
would you rather become
my spirit servant?

00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:44.160
What say you?

00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:50.840
I'd rather be born a beast

00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:58.320
than serve a wretched spirit like you.

00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:04.200
Do as you will.

00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:17.880
If you'll keep pursuing your grudge
against Khem,

00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:22.360
I shall bind my soul to hers

00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:26.080
to protect her in every life.

00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:34.320
You?

00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:36.800
What power do you have over me?

00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:49.000
Yod!

00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:50.240
Yod,

00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:51.440
don't do that.

00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:53.280
Yod...

00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:54.560
Yod!

00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:56.720
Don't do that.

00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:58.920
Stop.

00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:00.640
Yod...

00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:04.840
Please.

00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:06.480
Yod!

00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:11.720
What's going on?

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:14.240
What's happening here?

00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:17.160
See you soon.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.000
That malevolent spirit is 'Ramphueng.'

00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:36.500
She has great power

00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:39.780
and has lingered
for more than four centuries.

00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:45.080
That's all I know.

00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:48.720
Ramphueng.

00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:00.920
Khem,

00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:10.320
I'm sorry for everything.

00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:14.560
Everything I did

00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:19.760
was out of my love for you,

00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:24.360
even if it was a selfish kind of love.

00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:29.480
From here on,

00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:31.520
whether you choose to forgive me or not,

00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:36.440
I will bear the consequences.

00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:54.840
I forgive you, Mr. Chayod.

00:52:58.880 --> 00:52:59.760
Also...

00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:02.760
thank you

00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:06.600
for always protecting me.

00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:23.920
Wat,

00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:29.520
I entrust Khem to you.

00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:34.440
Take good care of him in this life,

00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:38.000
for you have loved him deeply
for so long.

00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:43.560
Farewell, Wat,

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:45.880
Khem.

00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:00.200
Leaving but telling me
to do things, huh?

00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:14.080
May you find peace in another life,

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:17.880
Yod.

00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:46.000
With you staring this hard,

00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:48.640
how am I supposed to eat?

00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:50.640
Uh...

00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:51.880
Sorry.

00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:55.440
I was just thinking of...

00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:57.520
- Ram...
- You're returning to Bangkok, right?

00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:02.520
Is there nothing to do at the camp?

00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:15.120
There you go

00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:17.680
shutting me down again.

00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:22.480
Now that we know who my karmic enemy is,

00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:26.080
aren't you going
to do something, Master?

00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:29.760
I helped you with Chayod

00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:33.080
only because that karma was bound to me.

00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:35.800
As for the rest,

00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:38.280
it's beyond my reach.

00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:43.640
But we've come this far, Master.

00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:49.040
You want me to break my promise
to my grandfather?

00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:57.840
I've done my part.

00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:02.280
The rest is yours to face.

00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:09.960
Wait here.

00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:18.840
There's still someone
waiting for your farewell.

00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:12.080
Let your mom know I said hi.

00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:14.880
I'll sleep in the hall tonight.

00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:18.480
Thanks, Jet.

00:57:58.960 --> 00:57:59.790
Mom,

00:58:04.590 --> 00:58:05.910
you're safe here.

00:58:09.670 --> 00:58:10.950
Please come to me.

00:58:19.710 --> 00:58:20.710
Mom...

00:58:25.230 --> 00:58:27.830
How am I supposed to eat
when you hug me this tight?

00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:34.550
I've been waiting for you
for years, Mom.

00:58:51.590 --> 00:58:52.470
Mom,

00:58:54.550 --> 00:58:55.750
why...

00:58:58.010 --> 00:58:59.790
have you never once come for me?

00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:03.070
I had only this much strength.

00:59:03.910 --> 00:59:05.910
If I had come to see you more often,

00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:08.710
I might have faded away
long before you grew up.

00:59:10.190 --> 00:59:11.390
I'm sorry, sweetie.

00:59:13.070 --> 00:59:14.350
I understand, Mom.

00:59:16.910 --> 00:59:18.390
I've always felt...

00:59:21.150 --> 00:59:23.550
your presence with me all along.

00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:29.270
Come on, let's eat.

00:59:39.630 --> 00:59:41.630
Don't you want some, too, sweetie?

00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:46.880
Master told me...

00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:50.040
- this...
- Meals prepared for spirits

00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:52.480
are not meant for the living to eat.

00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:55.600
Mom,

00:59:57.280 --> 00:59:58.280
you should try some.

00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:02.680
I made it with all my heart.

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:11.960
This is actually better than my food.

01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:17.360
You raised me well, Mom.

01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:21.400
I couldn't have done it without you.

01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:37.480
Don't cry, Mom.

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:46.960
It's been years
since we had a meal together.

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:06.880
- Let's eat, sweetie.
- Okay.

01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:13.120
Let's eat.

01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:15.280
The food's getting cold.

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:22.360
With cooking skills like this,

01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:25.760
you won't have any trouble
finding a lover.

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:29.840
I haven't had any.

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:42.640
Please send my thanks to Jet, Charn,

01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:44.520
and Master Paran.

01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:49.120
Everyone loves
and cares for you so much.

01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:52.440
I believe that Jet and Charn do,

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:54.810
but...

01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:56.600
Master?

01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:58.520
He's so cold and harsh.

01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:00.880
That's not true.

01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:03.640
He's just pretending to be cold.

01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:07.400
That one worries about you
more than anyone.

01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:10.280
What?

01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:13.320
Are we talking about the same Master?

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:19.760
He even saved you when you were little.

01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:22.520
What?

01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:25.400
But...

01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:29.840
I just met him
for the first time a few days ago.

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:33.200
How would that be possible?

01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:37.960
I took you to Grand Master Sek's place,

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.200
remember?

01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:41.280
I do.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:42.800
But...

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:45.640
have I met Master Paran before?

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:48.430
It was him

01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:51.680
who carried you all the way
to me and your dad.

01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:18.600
Hey!

01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:11.960
So it was him

01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:13.560
who saved me?

01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:15.380
Yes, sweetie.

01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:20.360
Now that you're with him,

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:22.200
I'm convinced

01:04:22.420 --> 01:04:25.840
that fate has sent a guardian
to watch over you.

01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:29.880
Just this much
is enough to ease my worries.

01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:31.530
But...

01:04:32.380 --> 01:04:33.530
about the curse,

01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:37.000
I'm not even sure...

01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:39.800
if he's gonna help me.

01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:42.320
But...

01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:44.520
don't worry, Mom.

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:48.080
I'll take good care of myself

01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:50.040
and...

01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:53.760
live a long life.

01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:56.720
I know you will.

01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:03.160
It's late now.

01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:07.320
I think it's time for me to leave.

01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:12.000
But...

01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:16.400
before you do,

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:21.600
can you sing me a lullaby
like you used to?

01:05:23.950 --> 01:05:24.920
Sure.

01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:27.000
Come on.

01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:43.680
♫Sleep now, honey, I'll lull you near♫

01:05:45.870 --> 01:05:53.350
♫Swinging you gently,
I'll be right here♫

01:05:54.760 --> 01:06:04.160
♫My little treasure, don't shed a tear♫

01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:14.200
♫My beautiful angel, you are my dear♫

01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:25.680
May you rest in peace, Auntie.

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:49.000
Pour the water and accept the blessing.

01:06:49.790 --> 01:07:19.600
(Chanting)

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:22.080
May you be blessed.

01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:47.520
(Chanting)

01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:51.400
May my parents be filled with happiness.

01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:01.080
In our next lives,

01:08:05.890 --> 01:08:07.970
I hope to be your child again, Mom.

01:08:28.479 --> 01:08:29.479
Dotty!

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:36.680
You've changed a lot, huh?

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.800
Looks like he remembers her now.

01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:55.359
That means he remembers you, too!

01:08:56.319 --> 01:08:59.520
You remembered him
right away, didn't you?

01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:02.880
Just help him already, Master.

01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:04.920
No need to act so reluctant.

01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:09.200
- Ouch...
- Ouch...

01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:20.880
Something's off. He didn't punish us.

01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:24.160
Maybe he's giving in?

01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:53.760
Sorry.

01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:56.240
Did I wake you up?

01:09:57.640 --> 01:09:58.960
Go sleep in the bedroom.

01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:11.760
Why are you doing it
right over where I sleep?

01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:13.480
Well,

01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:16.020
I'm cleaning every corner of the place.

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:17.800
Today?

01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:19.960
For what?

01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:21.320
Yeah.

01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:23.120
Maybe...

01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:25.440
it could change Master's mind.

01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:28.120
What's up with you?

01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:36.840
So,

01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:40.640
I've made up my mind.

01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:46.920
The club's going back to Bangkok soon,

01:10:47.980 --> 01:10:48.980
and...

01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:51.360
I want to ask Master
if I can stay here longer.

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:52.400
What?

01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:57.240
What happened?

01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:00.800
Weren't you mad at him just now?

01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:03.110
Are you possessed?

01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:05.880
Are you under a spell?

01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:07.880
Calm down!

01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:11.920
I just feel like

01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:14.440
he's not actually cruel.

01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:19.760
And at the very least,
if I stay here and make myself useful,

01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:22.800
he may change his mind.

01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:26.160
There you go, man!

01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:31.880
Don't worry.

01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:34.060
I'll help you out.

01:11:35.300 --> 01:11:36.600
I swear,

01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:39.040
this place will be spotless
before he wakes up.

01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:42.200
There won't be a speck of dust anywhere.

01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:44.280
Better keep your word.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Let's do it now, shall we?

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:50.280
Which room should we clean first?

01:11:51.020 --> 01:11:51.900
So...

01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:56.080
- This room?
- How about Master's?

01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:57.240
Let's clean this one first.

01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:33.720
Stop it, Ramphueng.

01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:35.400
You know my name?

01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:36.840
I was minding my own path.

01:12:37.060 --> 01:12:38.860
It is you who came to provoke me.

01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:40.960
Go into the forest

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.120
and look for red pieces of paper
rolled like this.

01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:44.520
Because it's not dark yet,

01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:46.760
Phrai, the territory holder,
is still awake.

01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:47.960
Phrai?

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:48.960
Who's that?

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:51.520
May I stay here
until the semester break ends?

01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:53.040
Please.

01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:54.340
Please, Master.

01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:58.720
Master's dad and Prim's were close,

01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:00.880
so they'd often visit each other.

01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:05.720
♫Our love would never fade away♫

01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:11.200
♫Eternal love lasts forever and always♫

01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:14.800
♫Even in death, my love will stay♫

01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:20.040
♫If this were our very last day,♫

01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:24.680
♫Our love would never fade away♫

01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:30.080
♫Eternal love lasts forever and always♫

01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:37.320
♫Even in death, my love will stay♫
