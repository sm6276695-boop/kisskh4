WEBVTT

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:06.650
Hello everyone.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.990
Well

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:13.990
I'm Kaishin Muto.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:15.170
This year's...

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.710
Co-creating the Future Oceans and Islands symposium...

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.030
officially begins now.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.250
So, first

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:23.680
please take a look at this.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.190
This is a photo of the seabed.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.040
This part

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:29.950
does anyone know what this is?

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:32.560
A type of rock?

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:34.560
A fire-resistant stone.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:35.870
Well guessing, but no...

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:37.680
Actually, this...

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.330
is coral.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.560
You're here.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.460
Don't look so annoyed seeing me.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.830
Big brother is so handsome, right?

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.940
Don't get me wrong

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.870
- I'm not here to pick a fight.
- Whatever. I don't feel anything.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:58.410
This symposium...

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.950
was supposed to be a one-time thing a few years ago.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.390
But Big brother insisted on keeping it going.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.930
He volunteered to handle all the troublesome work...

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.500
and convinced everyone.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.190
This island...

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.730
is my hometown.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.480
This ocean...

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.070
is my home.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.650
I think many of you consider home
to be where you live with family

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.990
or the place you return to at night.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.050
But...

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:43.930
for me, home is...

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.780
a place...

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.050
that confirms...

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.010
my existence.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.770
Ai-san.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.550
Thank you.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.130
Why the sudden thank me?

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.490
I didn't expect you to come this early

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:31.840
I'm happy.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.080
Just came to find some fun and kill time.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.290
Otherwise I wouldn't come.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.830
Hey.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.000
What are you doing?

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.230
Hold still.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.570
It's hot.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.260
No, you need to button up.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:51.930
Why?

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.240
Are you the class monitor?

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.760
Or the disciplinary teacher?

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.810
That's right.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.710
Very indecent.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:58.650
Huh?

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.180
In this refreshing scenery

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.140
full of bite marks is't good.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.870
But if you want to show off, that's fine, too.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.970
No.

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.210
This is perfect.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.660
Everyone will know the legendary handsome guy has a dog.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:18.900
A fierce dog at that.

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.350
A dog in heat.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.260
Then the owner must be in heat too.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.300
You...

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.740
Oh!

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.340
It's almost afternoon.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.590
Anywhere you want to go?

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.400
Don't you have other work?

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.970
Not today.

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.670
Or do you want to go back to work?

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.070
Go to Kaishin's house.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:38.510
Huh?

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:40.580
I want to go to Kaishin's house.

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:42.450
Take me there.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.260
Since I brought you home

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:50.910
stop hesitating.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.470
Do as you please.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.430
- Cut, good.
- Okay, this scene is done.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.030
Moving on to the next.

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:21.190
Well...

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:23.250
Hello...

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.280
Excuse me.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.240
Will you be staying to watch the next scene?

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.670
Oh, am I in the way?

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:32.670
No.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.790
It's just...

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.320
there's a back hug scene.

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.010
I am worried you might mind.

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:40.860
Ah, no, no, no, no.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.780
Please don't worry about me.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.350
After all, I'm Himeka-san's...

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.130
When it comes to Himeka-san

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.090
I'll give her my full support.

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:57.420
You're really...

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:58.940
a wonderful partner.

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.190
Partner...

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:14.590
Is this okay?

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.690
Teacher will be back tomorrow.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.330
I won't be able to look after Himeka-san like now.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:23.720
Will you be lonely?

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:26.320
No.

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:28.930
It's not about being loneliness

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.040
I'll be lonely.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.440
So from now on

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:37.690
come whenever you're free.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.530
Are you listening?

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:42.920
Yes.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.410
Let's wraps things up.

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.830
Thank you for this time, Fumi.

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:51.640
You're welcome.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.990
In that case, I'll give the capable secretary a reward.

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:05.210
How about a kiss on the forehead?

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:08.230
No.

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.000
Then I'll think of a better reward than that.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:14.920
Ah.

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.190
This isn't a reward.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.830
I thought I'd practice before filming.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.180
A little practice with my partner.

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:44.700
"Love Sea The Home for Lovers"
(Episode 5)

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:49.630
Are we there?

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:51.940
Maybe we should forget it?

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:53.410
My place is really small.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:55.580
I had no expectations from the start.

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:57.230
So hurtful...

00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:58.670
Stop babbling, hurry up.

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:00.360
Where is it?

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:01.710
Right there.

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:10.070
Awesome.

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:21.280
This is the workspace.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:23.730
Lots of diving gear.

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:27.100
There's a cat, too.

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:32.500
Just like you, Ai-san.

00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:37.280
Alright, let's go.

00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:38.930
Weren't you the one who wanted to come?

00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:40.590
Okay.

00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:44.100
This way.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:52.880
Come on in.

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:55.030
Excuse me.

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:08.210
Eh..

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:10.280
This is my room.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:16.170
Like an alien's home, isn't it?

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.070
Well...

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:20.060
Yeah.

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:25.830
Kaishin.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.620
Have you thought about leaving this island?

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:32.210
Not that I haven't.

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:33.120
Hmm?

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.240
If I studied elsewhere

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.640
maybe I could learn better ways to protect

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.680
this island and ocean.

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:44.690
All about island and ocean.

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:47.150
How did you get that idea.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:47.970
Huh?

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:49.130
Isn't it obvious?

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.230
Because I love them.

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:52.890
That's it?

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.260
That's why I fought with my dad.

00:09:58.010 --> 00:09:58.640
Huh?

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:02.260
What my dad cares about

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:04.410
is the catch right in front of him.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.170
He doesn't care about the environment and future.

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:15.070
When I was fifteen

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.290
we went fishing,

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.450
a sea turtle got caught in the net.

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:22.850
Guess what my dad did?

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:26.970
He threw the turtle and net into the sea together.

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:30.810
I got angry and said I'd save the turtle

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.680
so he threw me in, too.

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:34.740
That's terrible.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.540
The seabed I fell to was quite deep.

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.270
When I finally climbed up, dad said.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.430
If you want to save it, save it yourself.

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.050
I'm the one who feeding you.

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:49.820
Earn your own money before complaining.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.010
To a fifteen-year-old?

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:55.800
I was stubborn, didn't ask for help.

00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:58.130
But...

00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:01.590
one of my dad's crew members pulled me onto the boat.

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:04.740
Because of that

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:07.020
that man got fired.

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:13.270
That's why I left home

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:16.700
and I live here.

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:29.330
Are you trying to comfort me?

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.760
Is it working?

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.480
Seems I'm lucky today.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.230
It will get even better.

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:07.430
Take me.

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:31.750
Make me yours! Now!

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:50.180
This house has thin walls.

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:53.740
I want them to hear.

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.540
Do you know when to stop?

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:41.270
Whose fault is that?

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:44.320
If not me, you'd be crying now.

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:46.020
You're the one who's crying.

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:47.210
And so loudly.

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:49.320
The whole street heard.

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:51.350
Well

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:53.340
it's not my house anyway.

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:01.810
Let me be clear.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.070
I really can't take much more of this.

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:10.680
I probably used up a lifetime of luck.

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:15.310
Someone like you actually came to my house...

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:20.100
lying on my bed

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.490
in my arms...

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:27.550
Unbelievable.

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:30.530
You've never brought anyone home before?

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:32.230
Who could I bring?

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:34.910
True.

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:37.060
This might be a once-in-a-lifetime luck.

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:48.690
So you must remember forever.

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:52.000
I

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:54.060
have to go back tomorrow.

00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:58.280
Really.

00:15:58.310 --> 00:15:59.650
Time flew by.

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:05.090
Don't go.

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:13.670
Just kidding.

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:16.090
I have no right to ask you.

00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:17.190
Try it.

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:27.460
Go on, ask me.

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:30.370
Can I?

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:35.460
I'm at an age where I can be a little selfish.

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:38.000
If Kaishin ask me, I might agree.

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:46.800
I know.

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:50.020
When you want someone to grant your wish

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:52.220
you have to give something in return.

00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:55.310
But...

00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:59.160
I have nothing to give.

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:02.200
I don't want anything.

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:10.200
I've never asked even my parents.

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:13.440
So I won't force you.

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:18.190
But let me just say this.

00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:21.270
If...

00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:24.740
If I ask you and you say no...

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:29.560
I'll never be able to ask anyone again.

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:37.140
Don't go.

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:45.210
I promise.

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:47.810
I won't be mean to you

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:49.810
won't disturb your work

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:53.220
won't wake you up early.

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:56.460
I'll do whatever you say.

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:00.370
So...

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:07.630
Please stay with me.

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:14.150
That won't do.

00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:18.900
What's this about not being mean.

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:21.120
That's not like you.

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:24.490
If Kaishin doesn't wake me up

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:25.940
when would I start working?

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:30.450
Being obedient to everything

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:32.080
that's a spoiled dog.

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:37.220
Because you are you

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:41.690
you dare hold me in this shitty house

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:44.150
on this narrow bed.

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:48.760
Because you're Kaishin with guts

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:50.650
I'll grant your request.

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:54.520
Even if you don't behave

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:57.200
as long as you ask

00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:58.260
I'll make it happen for you.

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:02.190
I will stay.

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:13.080
What is it?

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:14.500
Huh?

00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:17.210
I don't want you to see me crying.

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:18.840
Are you crying?

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:22.950
No...

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:24.040
Don't poke me.

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:27.550
Stop poking me!

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:29.610
Teacher Ai.

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:32.050
Please come back no matter what.

00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:34.010
There's an important contract to sign tomorrow.

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:17.700
Oh.

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:18.590
Morning, big brother.

00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:21.090
Good morning.

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:22.310
That's great, isn't it?

00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:23.350
That handsome guy is going back.

00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:25.090
Yeah.

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:26.720
This trip...

00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:27.940
must be wonderful memories.

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:31.580
He'll definitely

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:34.000
come back again.

00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:40.810
Yeah.

00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:57.180
Huh?

00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:58.960
What's that?

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:00.240
What?

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:02.530
I thought you didn't have a car.

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:04.530
Did I ever say that?

00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:08.060
You picked me up in a gaudy tricycle

00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:10.300
and rode a motorcycle that hurt my butt.

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:13.390
This is for towing boats.

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:15.500
Shoud I tow you? Ai-san.

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:24.000
Stop sulking.

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:26.900
It's the last day after all.

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:40.510
I said no means no.

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:42.280
Can't extend the stay.

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:44.740
The contract meeting is absolutely unmissable.

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:52.540
I'm sorry.

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:56.430
It's okay.

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.470
The promise we made...

00:23:03.290 --> 00:23:04.790
I couldn't keep it.

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:28.880
Nothing forgotten?

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:39.310
A tip.

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:46.050
With such a big tip

00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:47.580
please come again next time.

00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:53.700
I probably won't come again.

00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:55.820
I suppose so.

00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:58.520
You came reluctantly this time.

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:03.660
When I first met you, you looked awful, I was worried.

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:06.020
Worry about yourself.

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:09.040
Eat breakfast properly.

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:10.750
Don't stay up late so often.

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:13.410
You're not young anymore.

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:15.470
You'll get wrinkles.

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:37.190
Kaishin.

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:41.060
I'm here.

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:42.960
Ai-san.

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:53.060
I have to go now.

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:01.540
I'll get that.

00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:03.190
This is expensive, right?

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:23.020
Aren't you going?

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:38.110
Ai-san.

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:40.620
What is it?

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:48.770
You must love the sea from your heart.

00:25:56.170 --> 00:25:57.460
This story...

00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:00.180
I'll never forget it.

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:07.340
Take care of yourself.

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:27.470
Kaishin.

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:29.870
So

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:32.000
weird name.

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:33.160
What's the origin?

00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:35.360
Because it matches your name.

00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:36.670
What?

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:37.960
How does it match?

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:41.500
Someday you'll

00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:43.390
fall in love with the ocean.

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:49.290
You must love the sea from your heart.

00:26:54.790 --> 00:26:55.720
How much?

00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:57.740
Huh?

00:26:58.370 --> 00:26:59.740
How much do I pay

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.290
to take Kaishin with me?

00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:05.320
Just a little longer.

00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:07.890
Just a little longer.

00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:11.450
I want to finish writing this story.

00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:15.490
I don't come cheap, you know

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:17.050
I can afford it.

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:26.330
Cleaning, checked.

00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:30.600
Meals, checked.

00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:35.320
And me?

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:38.440
Perfect.

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:41.200
Just arrived.

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:45.220
That was a long travel. You must be tired.

00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:48.420
Fumi, I've decided on your reward.

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:50.700
How about a kiss on the forehead?

00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:53.630
No.

00:28:54.970 --> 00:28:57.560
Then I'll think of a better reward than that.

00:28:58.060 --> 00:28:58.680
Ah.

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:00.200
You're making things difficult for me

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:03.530
- I need to prepare for Teacher Ai's return.
- Let's start right now.

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:06.810
Come.

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:10.680
Huh?

00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:12.960
Actress comfort lap pillow.

00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:15.720
This is something you can't enjoy even at a paid fan meet.

00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:18.140
You must have done something good in a past life.

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:23.110
I'd rather know what crime I committed in a past life...

00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:25.540
Oh.

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:27.840
Just rest when I tell you to

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:30.830
I'll wake you up on time.

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:37.420
Stop messing with me.

00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:54.120
You don't know anything.

00:31:11.390 --> 00:31:13.930
You're not into women.

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:21.390
Is Ai home?

00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:23.770
Seems like it.

00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:25.410
Yes.

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.090
Welcome home.

00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:33.830
Teacher Ai...

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.630
His name is written as "heart of the sea".

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:38.330
Kaishin.

00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:40.030
I bought him from the island.

00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:40.840
It's a pleasure to meet you.

00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:42.040
Huh?

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:43.740
Yes.

00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:45.340
I'm Kaishin.

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:32.960
Already asleep.

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:35.160
Sleeping soundly.

00:33:37.170 --> 00:33:39.080
He won't wake up, you can hold him.

00:33:42.610 --> 00:33:43.450
Moved.

00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:46.340
He just turned over.

00:33:47.510 --> 00:33:48.410
He even talks in his sleep.

00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:53.560
It's just an automated response message
