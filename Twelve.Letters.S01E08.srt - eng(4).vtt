00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.320
Take care.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.160
Thank you, sir.

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:21.199
Xun.

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:23.559
Does the light inside the crystal ball

00:00:23.559 --> 00:00:24.559
resemble aurora?

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.199
So beautiful.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.280
Aurora?

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:31.719
Is this what aurora looks like?

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:34.039
I don't know.

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:35.200
Never seen it either.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.159
But it looks like
the one on the postcards.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.759
So colorful.

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:42.439
It's beautiful.

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:48.920
Whatever it is,

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:50.719
it's pretty.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.840
(Meiwan Town General Store)
What do you want to do?

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:54.960
I'll buy it for you.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.520
It must be expensive.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.119
Don't.

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:58.399
It's okay. I can afford it now.

00:00:58.839 --> 00:00:59.679
Don't.

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:01.600
Why waste your money on this?

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.000
You like it.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.880
I'll buy it for you.

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:05.999
Don't worry.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.880
Listen.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:08.600
Don't buy it today.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.280
You can gift it to me on my birthday.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.240
Okay?

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:12.560
But I can buy it now.

00:01:12.736 --> 00:01:14.640
Gift it to me on my birthday
is more meaningful.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.480
Right?

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.159
Gift it to me on my birthday.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.599
Alright?

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.480
Alright.

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:22.519
It's settled then.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.079
On your birthday,

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:25.079
I'll buy one for you.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.480
No doubt.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:27.680
Okay.

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:32.359
When is your birthday?

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:33.719
You've never mentioned it.

00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:36.159
I don't remember my birthday.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.359
I knew the day I arrived

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:39.719
at the welfare house,

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.760
but I forgot it too.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.400
You've never celebrated a birthday?

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.159
What for? I'm not a child anymore.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.040
I'll gift it to you

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.359
for your birthday this year.

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:57.920
But it's not the only one gift.

00:01:58.239 --> 00:01:59.400
If you like or want

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.240
anything else,

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.480
just tell me.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.600
I'll get it for you.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.320
Alright.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.840
Let's go.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:10.039
Okay.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.120
Tang?

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:20.840
What is this?

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:24.800
Xun.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.199
I'll celebrate
your birthday today, okay?

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:29.599
Okay.

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:32.159
But why today?

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:36.199
Birthday could be your birthdate,

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:38.319
or any happy day.

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:39.560
In a year,

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.479
you need one day for this ritual.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.360
Old folks always say,

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.800
"It's always better do it today."

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:45.800
Why not

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.719
make it today, November 9th?

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:49.439
Do you agree?

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.840
I do.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.280
Then today is

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.520
the birthday you gave me,

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.200
and also

00:03:03.968 --> 00:03:05.216
my first birthday celebration.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.680
So it's settled.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.280
I'll be with you

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.040
on your birthday every year.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.280
It's too late today.

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:19.240
Birthday cakes were sold out.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.120
I only found this rice cake.

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:22.759
But next year,

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.400
I'll definitely get you

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.439
a huge birthday cake,

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:26.520
covered with candles.

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.879
Okay?

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.120
Make three wishes.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.400
Blow out the candles.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.840
I wish Ye Haitang

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.840
gets into her ideal university.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.120
I wish Ye Haitang

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:00.360
stays healthy and strong.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.800
I wish Ye Haitang

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.520
lives well

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:06.279
in this life.

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:16.759
I wish Tang Yixun a happy birthday.

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:19.160
May he be happy every single day.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.320
Blow out the candles.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.640
Okay.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.680
Let's do it together.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.439
Three, two, one.

00:05:45.079 --> 00:05:45.919
Tang.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.080
Listen to me.

00:05:48.519 --> 00:05:49.360
You go home first

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.480
and change your clothes.

00:05:53.079 --> 00:05:54.360
You didn't come here

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:56.120
and knew nothing about this.

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:57.839
I didn't come here?

00:05:58.319 --> 00:05:59.159
What's your plan?

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:00.199
Just do as I said.

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:00.759
No plan.

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:01.639
Just go back, okay?

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.960
What's your plan?

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.520
Go back.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.920
- Go back.
- No!

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:06.480
Go back.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.000
No.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.480
Go back!

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.320
No!

00:06:08.519 --> 00:06:10.040
I won't go. Let's face it together.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.600
Let's face it together.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.199
- Let's face it together.
- Tang.

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:14.720
They tried to kill us.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.079
Ye Haitang! Ye Haitang!

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.519
Listen to me! Please listen!

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:21.319
You go back. Please go back.

00:06:21.359 --> 00:06:22.199
No.

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:23.560
Let's face it together.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.240
They tried to kill us.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.439
There is no "us".

00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:31.720
Only me.

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:34.480
You have a bright future.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.680
You need to go to college.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.519
What about you?

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:46.159
Y...

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.120
You...

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:48.479
live well for me.

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:51.159
You live well for me.

00:06:51.999 --> 00:06:52.839
No!

00:06:52.839 --> 00:06:53.679
No!

00:07:55.399 --> 00:07:56.279

What are you doing?

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.560
What are you doing? Answer me!

- Leave!

I can testify.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.360
Take them to interrogation.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.040

Leave!

I'm Ye Haitang?

00:28:32.759 --> 00:28:33.599
What is it?

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:36.559
Cha left some money with me.

00:28:37.359 --> 00:28:38.440
He said it's for you.

00:28:39.799 --> 00:28:40.639
What money?

00:28:41.759 --> 00:28:42.960
He said he owed it to you.

00:29:00.839 --> 00:29:01.960
You keep the money.

00:29:04.039 --> 00:29:05.559
I need to go out of town.

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:07.480

Mom, stop pushing.

00:32:22.119 --> 00:32:24.079
I'm strong now.

00:32:25.079 --> 00:32:26.680
Teng has grown up!

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:29.160
Dad, pull harder!

00:32:29.359 --> 00:32:30.199
Got it.

00:32:31.599 --> 00:32:34.240
If buying a boat, get a big one!

00:32:35.799 --> 00:32:37.200
Who'll sail it?

00:32:37.359 --> 00:32:38.759
I can learn.

00:32:38.759 --> 00:32:39.799
He learns to sail it.

00:32:39.799 --> 00:32:41.599
And you learn English, Xun.

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:43.480
We'll do export business,

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:44.960
negotiate with foreigners,

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:46.640
and earn US dollars.

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:49.039
- US dollars!
- US dollars!

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:51.079
Then Cha can finally marry

Xin.

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:53.960
By then,

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:55.160
you can buy

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:56.759
those American sneakers

00:32:58.359 --> 00:32:59.880

00:33:00.359 --> 00:33:01.759
No need to ask me for money.

00:33:01.759 --> 00:33:03.519

00:33:03.519 --> 00:33:04.359
Yes, yes.

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:05.519

Did someone come by earlier?

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:50.040
What?

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:51.160
Well, the stuff

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:52.520
at that grave.

00:33:52.839 --> 00:33:54.240

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:55.240

00:33:57.359 --> 00:33:59.559
She always cleans the place spotless,

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.400
and comes with a cake.

00:34:05.279 --> 00:34:06.119
Where is she now?

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:08.239
She just dropped the stuff

00:34:08.239 --> 00:34:09.199
and left.

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:11.600
Thanks, madam.

(I'll be with you
on your birthday every year.)

00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:00.400
(It's too late today.)

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:01.880

00:36:02.159 --> 00:36:04.159

00:36:04.599 --> 00:36:05.559
(But next year,)

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:07.599
(I'll definitely get you)

00:36:07.599 --> 00:36:09.000
(a huge birthday cake,)

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.400
(covered with candles.)

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:11.600

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:55.760
Hurry up.

00:38:27.079 --> 00:38:27.919
Hello.

00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:29.760
Hello.

Whose call is this?

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:36.480
Mom, they don't speak.

00:38:37.239 --> 00:38:38.079
Give it to me.

00:38:39.079 --> 00:38:39.919
Hello.

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:41.200
Who is this?

00:38:49.639 --> 00:38:51.119
Probably a wrong number.

00:38:51.599 --> 00:38:53.199
I made sweet and sour ribs.

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:49.079

(Any place you want to visit?)

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:53.440
(I want to see snowfall.)

00:39:53.639 --> 00:39:54.960
(I've never seen heavy snow.)

00:39:55.119 --> 00:39:56.079
(Me neither.)

00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:57.519

00:39:58.599 --> 00:39:59.480
(wherever it snows.)

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:01.640

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:34.000
Who's there?

00:40:34.239 --> 00:40:35.280
Come in.

00:40:58.320 --> 00:40:59.320
Can I help you?

00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:02.800
I...

00:41:05.159 --> 00:41:06.719
I'm Yu Zhiyong's friend.

00:41:10.639 --> 00:41:11.679
I came to visit you.

00:41:14.119 --> 00:41:16.159
Well, come in.

00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:17.240
Dad.

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:22.240
Dad.

00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:29.800
Nian.

00:41:30.639 --> 00:41:31.479
Look.

00:41:32.599 --> 00:41:34.039
So many delicious dishes.

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:36.719
Plenty of food.

00:41:43.559 --> 00:41:44.480
Here, let's eat.

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:46.760
Thank you.

00:41:47.199 --> 00:41:49.400
I shouldn't let guests cook.

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:50.680
Eat while it's hot.

00:41:53.519 --> 00:41:54.359
Here.

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:01.480
Try this.

00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:16.800
Dad.

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:20.320
Grandma says you drive big trucks,

00:42:20.599 --> 00:42:23.840
the really huge ones.

00:42:34.239 --> 00:42:37.079
Where do you drive them, Dad?

00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:39.400
Whenever I ask Grandma,

00:42:39.599 --> 00:42:42.039
she says you're down south,

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:44.599
very far away.

00:42:45.159 --> 00:42:46.840
So every time,

00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:49.559
it takes forever for you to come back.

00:43:04.639 --> 00:43:05.479
Dad.

00:43:05.599 --> 00:43:07.639
Can I come with you?

00:43:08.199 --> 00:43:09.039
Nian.

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:11.800
Focus on eating.

00:43:28.239 --> 00:43:29.320
Good girl.

00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:34.199
I always cough.

00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:45.000
Dad's cooking

00:43:45.559 --> 00:43:46.599
is so delicious.

00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:48.920
Can I have it tomorrow?

00:43:49.199 --> 00:43:50.079
Nian.

00:44:31.079 --> 00:44:32.199
From now on,

00:44:34.199 --> 00:44:36.079
I will cook delicious meals
for you every day.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:37.840
Okay?

00:44:38.199 --> 00:44:39.039
Okay.

00:44:39.039 --> 00:44:39.879
Okay.

00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:42.200
Have some more.

00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:44.160
Here.

00:44:51.199 --> 00:44:52.079
Try this.

00:44:58.239 --> 00:44:59.360
Have some meat.

00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:08.240
Have some water.

00:45:11.679 --> 00:45:13.599
Dr. Hao just told me

00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:15.239
you have

00:45:15.239 --> 00:45:16.280
improved these days.

00:45:17.239 --> 00:45:19.559
I know how serious my illness is.

00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:22.679
Don't waste money on me.

00:45:24.159 --> 00:45:24.999
Don't worry about

00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:26.320
the money.

00:45:27.119 --> 00:45:27.959
Take good rest.

00:45:29.159 --> 00:45:30.079
Kid,

00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:34.360
you promised Yong to visit us

00:45:35.559 --> 00:45:37.119
and travelled all this way.

00:45:37.719 --> 00:45:39.519
It is already enough.

00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:42.440
We've taken too much of your time.

00:45:44.599 --> 00:45:45.599
Don't let us

00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:46.679
hold you back.

00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:52.559
Since I'm here,

00:45:53.239 --> 00:45:54.519
I can't just leave.

00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:57.280
I have no home,

00:45:57.960 --> 00:45:58.800
no mom,

00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:04.079
and no one around.

00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:06.360
If you don't mind,

00:46:07.559 --> 00:46:09.159
I'll treat you well for Yong.

00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:11.000
I'll be your son.

00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:16.360
I'll take care

00:46:17.199 --> 00:46:18.039
of you and Nian.

00:46:53.559 --> 00:46:54.399
Dr. Wang.

00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:56.119
Is there any other way?

00:46:56.559 --> 00:46:57.440
Money's not the issue.

00:46:57.599 --> 00:46:59.159
I understand how you feel,

00:46:59.639 --> 00:47:01.039
but your mother's illness

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:02.320
isn't looking good.

00:47:03.719 --> 00:47:05.079
Prepare the funeral.

00:47:31.731 --> 00:47:34.500
(Xi Town, Beixing, City Bus)

00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:45.720
Dad.

00:47:46.159 --> 00:47:47.840
Where are we going?

00:47:52.679 --> 00:47:53.599
Nian,

00:47:54.199 --> 00:47:55.360
you're going to kindergarten.

00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:58.159
We'll live in a big apartment.

00:47:59.159 --> 00:47:59.999
Okay?

00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:23.800
Nian.

00:48:25.079 --> 00:48:26.000
Look over there.

00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:27.160
A big ship!

00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:31.079
Dad, will we ride that ship?

00:48:33.559 --> 00:48:34.760
Nian,

00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:36.239
do you like big ships?

00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:37.599
Yes.

00:48:40.079 --> 00:48:40.920
Then we'll buy a home

00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:42.679
and stay here. Okay?

00:48:43.079 --> 00:48:44.119

00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:45.200

Dad, let's race!

00:48:48.039 --> 00:48:49.960
Ready? Go!

00:48:51.679 --> 00:48:52.559
Yong, you're late.

00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:53.960
Yeah.

00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:54.800
Haven't eaten yet?

00:48:56.559 --> 00:48:57.399

00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:58.920
I only made five yuan today.

00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:00.920
I still haven't eaten.

00:50:49.599 --> 00:50:51.039
I obeyed my teachers

00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:52.760
when I was little.

00:50:53.199 --> 00:50:54.039
What teachers said

00:50:54.039 --> 00:50:55.039
are always right.

00:50:56.559 --> 00:50:57.840
So promise me,

00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:00.280
always obey your teachers at school.

00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:01.120
Okay?

00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:05.600
Nian.

00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:07.960
After school,

00:51:08.639 --> 00:51:10.360
wait for me at the school gate.

00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:11.200
Don't wander around.

00:51:11.319 --> 00:51:12.159
Got it?

00:51:12.159 --> 00:51:12.999
Dad.

00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:16.559
You've worked at the shipyard so long.

00:51:16.559 --> 00:51:19.039
When will you finally build a big ship?

00:51:23.559 --> 00:51:24.399
Nian.

00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:26.519
Building a big ship

00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:28.039
isn't that easy.

00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:29.599
But I promise you,

00:51:30.079 --> 00:51:32.039
when I finally build that ship,

00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:34.280
I'll take you sailing right away.

00:51:34.559 --> 00:51:35.399
Okay?

00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:36.559
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:51:37.199 --> 00:51:38.400
Let's go to school.

00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:43.480
Come on.

00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:44.280
(Wang Jianguo.)

00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:44.960
(Yes, yes.)

00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:45.559
Forty.

00:51:45.559 --> 00:51:46.399
Sign here.

00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:52.360
Next, Yu Zhiyong.

00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:54.840
Eighty. Sign here.

00:51:57.480 --> 00:51:58.480
Can you weld?

00:51:58.760 --> 00:51:59.600
Yes, I can.

00:51:59.799 --> 00:52:00.639
Alright.

00:52:00.639 --> 00:52:02.159
Be at the workshop

00:52:03.039 --> 00:52:03.960
tomorrow at 7:00 AM.

00:52:06.599 --> 00:52:07.719
Thank you. Thank you!

00:52:07.719 --> 00:52:08.280
Thank you.

00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:09.120
It's nothing.

00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:10.720
Yong!

00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:15.240
- Mei.
- Yong.

00:52:16.239 --> 00:52:17.400
You wanted to see me?

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:20.360
I need

00:52:20.639 --> 00:52:21.559
to ask you a favor.

00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:23.440
Don't mention it.

00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:24.519
I can always help you.

00:52:24.519 --> 00:52:25.359
What's wrong?

00:52:25.599 --> 00:52:27.079
I'm going out of town for a few days.

00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:28.360
Could you

00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:29.760
look after Nian for me?

00:52:30.079 --> 00:52:31.320
Take her to my place.

00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:33.119
She can stay with us at night.

00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:34.360
Thank you.

00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:35.239
Don't mention it.

00:52:35.239 --> 00:52:36.280
We're friends.

00:52:37.519 --> 00:52:38.960
Here, take this money.

00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:40.320
What are you doing?

00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:40.800
Stop it.

00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:41.719
Don't do that.

00:52:41.719 --> 00:52:42.599
No need.

00:52:42.599 --> 00:52:43.880
We're friends and colleagues.

00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:44.720
No, take it.

00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:45.480
Don't.

00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:46.440
I'm leaving.

00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:47.239
Come on.

00:52:47.239 --> 00:52:47.840
Right,

00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:49.480
bring her to the compound gate tonight.

00:53:15.316 --> 00:53:19.936
(Tang Yixun's Grave)

00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:24.200
Xun.

00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:27.599
It's your birthday again.

00:53:31.519 --> 00:53:33.679
I've kept our promise.

00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:36.119
I'm living well.

00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:38.159
You can rest assured.

00:53:43.079 --> 00:53:44.960
I went to see snowfall last month.

00:53:46.039 --> 00:53:47.159
The actual snowfall.

00:53:47.639 --> 00:53:48.599
It was very beautiful.

00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:50.639
I will try my best

00:53:50.639 --> 00:53:52.719
to live well for both of us.

00:53:54.239 --> 00:53:56.280
I'll make sure you see from heaven

00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:00.079
that everything you did for me
wasn't in vain.

00:54:08.639 --> 00:54:09.479
Xun.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.239
Life is long.

00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:17.840
We'll probably meet again.

00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:26.160
Xun.

00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:29.559
Happy birthday.

00:54:32.199 --> 00:54:33.679
May you be happy every single day.

Done your work?

We're getting benefits.

00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:12.280
Go get yours.

take some of mine?

00:56:19.079 --> 00:56:20.079
My parents work here.

00:56:20.079 --> 00:56:21.159
We get multiple sets.

00:56:21.159 --> 00:56:22.159
Take some.

00:56:22.159 --> 00:56:23.199
No, thank you.

00:56:27.639 --> 00:56:30.239
take the cookies back for Nian.

00:56:32.559 --> 00:56:33.960
Take it. I give it to the kid.

00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:35.280
Come on. Take it!

00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:37.600
Just take it.

00:56:39.159 --> 00:56:39.999
Thank you.

00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:41.159
Don't mention it.

00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:46.840
You've been busy lately, Yong.

00:56:47.039 --> 00:56:48.719
If you're that busy, send the kid to me.

00:56:48.759 --> 00:56:49.599
Or

00:56:49.599 --> 00:56:51.760
I could go cook for you.

00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:53.320
I can cook and clean.

00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:55.599
I'm good at making buns,

00:56:55.599 --> 00:56:56.559
noodles and stews.

00:56:56.559 --> 00:56:57.800
No, thank you.

00:56:59.159 --> 00:57:01.039
It's fine. I'm single anyway.

00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:02.800
I have time.

00:57:13.159 --> 00:57:13.999
Mei,

00:57:15.159 --> 00:57:17.360
you've been kind to me and Nian.

00:57:18.079 --> 00:57:19.840
I really thank you.

00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:23.360
But,

00:57:23.639 --> 00:57:25.280
I really don't plan to remarry.

00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:26.800
Don't waste time on me.

00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:31.920
Yong, what are you talking about?

00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:32.760
I didn't mean that.

00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:34.039
I-I just...

00:57:34.039 --> 00:57:35.119
I just like the kid.

00:57:35.119 --> 00:57:35.959
I...

00:57:37.639 --> 00:57:39.079
Alright, I understand.

00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:41.360
Let's stay friends

and colleagues.

00:57:43.159 --> 00:57:43.999
Well,

00:57:45.079 --> 00:57:46.960
if you need help, send Nian to me.

00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:47.800
I'll look after her.

00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:49.240
Thank you.

00:57:52.639 --> 00:57:53.479
I...

00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:55.320
Alright, you...

00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:56.559
I'll head home.

00:57:57.079 --> 00:57:58.199
Tell me if you need help.

00:58:01.159 --> 00:58:01.999
Thank you.
