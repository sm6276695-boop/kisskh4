=Episode 9=

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.510
Swan County is just up ahead.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:35.750
Hyah.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.910
Okay.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.170
Tread carefully on this journey.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.510
Do not reveal your identity.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:41.800
Understood.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.140
(Swan County)

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.420
(Swan County, Yuzhang Commandery)

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.430
Whoa.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.380
Time for me to keep up with the times

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.290
and take on a new name.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.520
New name? What name?

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.720
The Qi family name...

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.760
I'm still a Qi.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:11.970
But I don't want to give up Liu either.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.430
I also want to use the name Haihun.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.560
What about Qi Liuhai (bangs)?

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:19.550
How's that?

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:21.960
That's a fine name.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.180
Very fine, truly fitting.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.940
Since the Marquis has a new name,

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.270
I should follow suit.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.230
Lord Wang.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.360
Help me think of one too.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.710
Preferably,
with "Hai" in it like the Marquis.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.590
How

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.040
about Di Zhonghai (bold guy)?

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.760
Di Zhonghai.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.660
The sea is vast and boundless,

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.840
yet I'm the land
encircling the sea instead.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.250
Lord Wang, what an excellent name.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.190
That's a fine name.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.680
Lord Sun, truly fitting.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.000
It suits you.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.400
Heng, you should pick one, too.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.240
Silence.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.680
I'm innocent.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.000
You old woman.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.220
Trying to harass Wu Sheng here.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.690
Such behavior offends public morals.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:12.560
How defiant!

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.920
I didn't.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.520
Go, beat her hard!

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.750
Beat her hard!

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:24.800
Stop!

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.860
How can you treat
the commoners this way?

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.520
Do you deserve the uniform you wear?

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.790
Insolent rogue!

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.620
How dare you meddle in my affairs?

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.400
Of course.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:35.880
- I'm warning you...
- Don't.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.140
Let's find out what's going on

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.080
before we do anything.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.360
Who are you?

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.830
I'm a traveler passing through.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.030
Your behavior

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.360
isn't quite right, is it?

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.000
You travelers
should mind your own business.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.150
Oh?

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:54.760
That's a rather unique outfit.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.560
This robe

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.430
suits my taste perfectly.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:59.890
Take it off and hand it over now,

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.510
and the matter ends here.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:03.850
Not taking it off, huh?

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.230
Then I'll take it off myself.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:10.990
You made the first move.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.350
Take them down!

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.440
You dare defy the local officers?

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.410
Just wait and see.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.160
Good, good.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.240
Ma'am.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.200
Come on.

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:42.270
Get up.

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.920
Ma'am.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.360
Ma'am, what happened?

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.800
I couldn't afford the breathing tax.

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.520
I never teased the young men.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.470
Ma'am.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.000
Our country has never imposed

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.710
the breathing tax.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.040
It only exists here.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:03.560
If you can't pay it,

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.680
they'll make up some charge against you.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.240
Then you'll face punishment.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.080
What's going on?

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.920
Di Zhonghai.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:09.830
Don't look at me.

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.600
I know nothing about this.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:12.630
Ma'am.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.910
If you can't pay,
what kind of punishment will it be?

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.880
If you can't pay,

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.000
they'll send you

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.720
to the Marquis's mausoleum

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.200
to work as laborers.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.650
All the more reason we should help them.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:26.800
Yeah.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:38.110
You said it.

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.020
Don't draw attention.

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:41.680
Brazen woman!

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.820
Do you admit your guilt?

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.400
At dusk yesterday,
did you tease Wu Sheng in the fields?

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.870
Lord Hu, I'm innocent!

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.390
I swear on my life and honor

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.500
that I never teased Wu Sheng.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.210
(Hu Kuan, Magistrate of Swan County)
Wu Sheng, speak.

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:58.270
Lord Hu, at dusk yesterday,

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:59.970
I was working in the fields,

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.800
and this woman suddenly came up

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.410
and persistently teased me,

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.180
speaking with shameless levity.

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:09.790
That was rather disgraceful.

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:11.600
She even grabbed at my clothes.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.030
Thankfully, I ran off in time.

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.820
Or I'd have fallen into her clutches.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.800
I was at home at dusk yesterday.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.600
Why would I go to the fields?

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.000
Is there anyone who can testify?

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:25.140
- I was home alone.
- Oh.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.190
Then it's impossible to prove.

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:28.860
Wu Sheng.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.530
Do you have any proof?

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:36.560
Milord, please look at my back.

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.260
(A cute young man in the fields;
a fine match for me.)

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.810
I don't think the lady fancies the lad.

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:43.890
More likely,
she didn't pay the breathing tax.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:44.820
Breathing tax?

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:47.600
That does make sense.

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:49.050
Such a domineering inscription.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.050
The lady barely knows her letters.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.800
With both witness and proof,

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.290
what else can you possibly say?

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:56.800
I...

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:58.350
Very well.

00:06:58.650 --> 00:06:59.860
The case is now clear.

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:03.450
This old woman tried to seduce
the young man but failed,

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:05.100
which is truly disgraceful.

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:06.750
I'll give you two choices.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.680
First, pay this year's
breathing tax in full

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.510
for this lad and yourself.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.160
Second, perform corvée work

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:14.120
so as to warn others.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:15.280
Corvée work...

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:16.560
At the Marquis's mausoleum?

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:17.520
Exactly.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:18.500
It'll be hard to return.

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:19.390
That's too cruel.

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:20.720
I've heard the Marquis

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.910
takes five lives every night.

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:25.080
No one sent there for corvée work

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:26.870
has ever returned alive.

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:30.370
What's your plan?

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.790
That poor lady can't be
the only one wrongly accused.

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:35.240
I want to get them all out first.

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:36.890
- Let me go with you.
- No.

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:37.930
Absolutely not.

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:39.650
You're the best fighter.

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:41.070
I need you to protect us secretly,

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.170
in case something happens.

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:43.030
If danger comes,

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.260
act as you see fit.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.200
Alright.

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:48.260
Guards!

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.000
Take this woman away.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:51.520
- Yes.
- Milord!

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.230
I've been wronged, milord!

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:54.980
- This is outrageous!
- Milord!

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.310
With such a verdict...

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:57.150
I am truly wronged!

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.920
You're trampling on our laws

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.540
and crushing justice!

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:02.120
It wasn't even your turn yet,

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.110
and you've already jumped out.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:05.530
Who are you?

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:06.580
I am

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:07.750
Qi Liuhai.

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:09.410
I am Di Zhonghai.

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:11.210
In broad daylight,

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:12.920
why should we pay tax for breathing?

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.830
Ha ha ha.

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:17.680
If I say you pay, you pay.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.870
That's the law.

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:22.970
You corrupt official,
twisting right and wrong.

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:24.240
You're utterly brazen.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.110
Insolent commoner, how dare you?

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.330
You're exactly who I'm hitting.

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:28.450
Don't move.

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:31.310
You've got nerve, Qi Liuhai.

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:32.270
You...

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:35.620
The Colonel of the Huben Army is here.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.040
(Order)
Don't you dare move.

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:45.470
Oh.

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:47.280
Colonel.

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:48.590
Sorry for the lack of welcome.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.150
Pardon me.

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:51.440
Seize them all.

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:53.160
Take them away.

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:56.620
Insolent commoners!

00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:58.830
How dare you beat me?

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:00.000
Who gave you such courage?

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.660
To hit you, I need no one's courage.

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:03.480
- Do you know who I answer to?
- Who?

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:04.490
I don't care.

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:06.710
You...

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:10.860
Come on, Colonel.

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:12.090
Look.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:16.200
They have no respect for you.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.750
They are quite bold, indeed.

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:19.310
Oh, right.

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:20.890
Bold, very bold.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:21.920
Hey.

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:26.080
Send this band of arrogant fools
to Lord Luo tomorrow.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.450
Let's see how he deals with you.

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:28.510
Take them all away.

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:33.480
What does this gesture mean?

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.440
That's called OK.

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:35.870
It means all right.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.010
It means completed.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.340
Easy there.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:53.870
Colonel.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.440
Care to explain the breathing tax?

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.550
Colonel.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:02.080
That was on orders from Lord Luo.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.630
I'm just here carrying them out.

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:05.320
All I can do is follow orders.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:07.560
Lord Luo?

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:08.590
Oh.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.480
I'll introduce you
to Lord Luo another time.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.510
We serve in the lower ranks.

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:15.580
You serve by His Majesty's side
in Chang'an.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:16.710
When the time comes,

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:18.550
lend us a hand, will you?

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:21.470
Heh heh heh.

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:24.860
Put in a few good words for us.

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:26.840
Hurry up, keep up.

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.730
Li San, open the door.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.080
Get inside.

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:37.790
Move.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:41.560
Inside.

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:47.810
Don't be afraid.

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:49.720
I'm not here to harm you.

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:52.650
We only want to know the truth.

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:54.250
What on earth happened today?

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:57.120
I wronged that woman.

00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:01.560
The Magistrate wrote
the ridiculous evidence on my back.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.020
That's just your word.

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:05.970
It won't hold without proof.

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:09.020
We'll need a piece

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:11.280
of physical evidence.

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:16.480
Anyone with eyes can see it.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:17.950
Why did you play along today?

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:23.500
I can't afford
this year's breathing tax.

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:26.930
The officers want to drag me
to build the Marquis's mausoleum.

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:31.140
They say that there is
no place for the living.

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.440
I'm not fit for heavy labor.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.480
The Magistrate knew
that woman was strong,

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:39.890
so he ordered me to frame her.

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:42.000
Who set this breathing tax?

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:45.560
Lord Luo of Kangcheng.

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:50.900
Ah, I hate this so much.

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:52.190
Why are you wailing so late?

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.690
Heaven and Earth can be my witnesses.

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:57.560
Such wicked deeds happened,
and I knew nothing of it.

00:11:58.670 --> 00:11:59.880
Knew nothing?

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:01.230
I think...

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:02.200
Don't scare him.

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:06.240
We believe you.

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:09.640
Right now, the truth matters most.

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:12.260
By the way,

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:16.680
how is Lady De Jiu now?

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:19.310
The highest art of concealment
is to hide in plain sight.

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.290
Since we're in the shadows now,

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.180
doesn't that make it double insurance?

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:26.070
I see. That's clever.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.630
Up, up, come on!

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:32.530
Hurry, hurry!

00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:33.370
Get up!

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:34.310
Everyone, on your feet!

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:36.790
Come on, everyone!

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.120
Up now, no delays!

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:43.120
Move it, stop dawdling!

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.040
It's not even 8 AM yet.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.360
Why get up so soon?

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.280
8 AM?

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:49.800
His Majesty's routine?

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.270
Nothing, just Morning Qi.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.210
Morning Qi?

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.990
Morning Qi is just Qigong
in the morning.

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:01.590
Oh.

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:04.240
Go, go, go!

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.240
How can you work dressed like that?

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:08.620
Hurry and change.

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:09.960
Move!

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.730
These unruly folks
need to be taught a lesson.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.720
If we don't, they won't obey.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.290
Such stubborn bones.

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:20.690
Ah, I'm exhausted.

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:21.730
Behave yourselves.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.120
You'll suffer less that way.

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:25.240
Especially you troublemakers
in the lead.

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:26.350
Alright, alright.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:28.930
Colonel.

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:30.990
Give me a hand, will you?

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:34.800
My back itches.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:35.760
I can't reach it.

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:36.800
Itches?

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:37.910
Lashings will stop the itch.

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:38.900
I'll do it.

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:40.600
Heh, careful.

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:42.700
Walk faster.

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.440
I carry the Governor's badge
given by Lord Sun.

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:47.020
You can use it to mobilize the troops.

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:48.320
Just in case of emergencies.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.550
Ah, right there, that tickles.

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:52.760
Oh, so ticklish.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:53.760
Yes, right there.

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:54.720
There it is.

00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:57.000
Yes, yes... Ah!

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.460
Why hit me?

00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:59.850
- It hurts!
- Good, it should.

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:01.040
Then it won't tickle anymore.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:04.560
Hurry, move out.

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:07.760
What's that saying again?

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:10.050
It's neither affection nor love.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.080
Go.

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:15.430
You unruly folks, stay put inside.

00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:16.950
Keep watch.

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:18.420
Get inside.

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:19.330
Colonel.

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:20.190
Please, this way.

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:21.600
- Move!
- Careful.

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:22.500
Hurry up.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.650
Get in, move.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:25.720
Behave yourself.

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:26.680
Keep up.

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:30.260
- Crouch down.
- Stay low.

00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:34.780
Quickly.

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:35.690
Yes.

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:36.620
You, too.

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:39.040
Such cruelty.

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:40.790
Truly outrageous.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:42.240
I'm talking to you.

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:48.380
Guess what's inside this chest.

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:51.280
Move faster.

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:55.230
Get in.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.080
In.

00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:57.880
Move.

00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:58.750
Stay crouched.

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:00.550
These commoners have suffered enough.

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:02.320
Have some mercy.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.240
Spare them the lash.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.870
How dare you, a mere commoner,
meddle in my affairs?

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:08.160
Let me tell you all.

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:10.380
Your fate will be far worse than theirs.

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:12.590
They aren't even worthy
to be called commoners.

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:14.240
And you are no better.

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:15.550
In my eyes,

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:16.850
you're all just slaves.

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:18.250
Do you understand?

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.600
Aren't you just a petty yamen runner

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:23.340
bossed around by your superiors?

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:24.360
Why are you so arrogant?

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.200
Humph.

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:27.170
Saying this to me changes nothing.

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:29.420
I can still make you all serve me.

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:31.720
Don't even think of pleading for them.

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:33.870
You can't even save yourselves now.

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:35.560
Yet you meddle in their troubles.

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:41.700
Stay calm.

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:43.600
- Endure it.
- I can't take it.

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:44.440
Endure it for now.

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:45.930
Find the evidence.

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:47.900
How?

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:48.750
Shh.

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:50.000
Let me handle it.

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:13.580
Hey, what did you find?

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:14.930
All gold.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.320
The gold

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:20.080
likely came from your mausoleum.

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:23.460
Building your mausoleum
was just a cover to mine gold.

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:26.600
The one behind this is quite greedy.

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.200
They want both wealth and people.

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:29.120
And even me.

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:33.800
Kangcheng has a strong force.

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:35.270
Take Lord Sun's command token

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:36.400
and call for reinforcements.

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:40.800
Up, up, quickly.

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:41.810
Colonel.

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:43.610
Move, hurry.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:45.700
- Colonel.
- Go.

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.130
Let's head out.

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:48.940
- Lord Luo must be getting impatient.
- Go.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:51.740
- I've escorted them here.
- Hurry.

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:53.280
- I'll take my leave.
- Go.

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:56.760
Stay for a meal with Lord Luo
before you go.

00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:59.200
We still have many matters
needing your help.

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:01.690
Which one is more important,

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:03.960
dining with Lord Luo
or serving His Majesty?

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:05.610
I wouldn't dare.

00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:08.650
I will return.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:09.940
We'll discuss it then.

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:19.310
Milady, come back soon.

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:22.020
We still have much to talk about.

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:26.110
Commoners.

00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:26.950
Get up, all of you.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.350
Take them all away.

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.130
Lord Luo's getting impatient.

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:34.250
- Come here.
- Move.
