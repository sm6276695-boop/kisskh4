[The Journey of Legend]

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.930
[Episode 8]

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.490
[Qunfang House]

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:48.350
Miss Hongxiu.

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.240
Someone is causing us trouble.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.370
I wonder if we could

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:54.710
hide here for a while.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.509
Third Young Master, what are you saying?

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.840
Everyone knows that the Xiao Residence

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.700
is under siege.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.410
I heard your family

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.560
is doing something important
for the country and its people.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.950
As a mere courtesan,

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.210
I'm happy to offer what little help I can.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:12.210
Thank you.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.240
No need to thank me.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.240
Besides,

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.920
aren't you a regular here?

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.920
It's only right that I help you.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.430
I'm... not.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.400
Mister, please don't misunderstand.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.760
Third Young Master used to come here

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.990
to help these girls.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.680
When thugs bullied them,

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.680
only he treated us like human beings

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:35.770
and stood up for us.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.900
We're all grateful for his kindness.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.280
It was the right thing to do.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:44.350
By the way,

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:45.710
this place is too conspicuous

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:46.680
and not very safe.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.740
I'll take you to another place later.

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:52.590
How can we leave town now?

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.280
Leave town?

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.760
All roads out of town
are blocked by those men.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.830
We need to find a way out.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.910
Oh right, there's a party
outside out of town today.

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.070
They requested some girls
for entertainment.

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.950
Unless...

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.040
Unless what?

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.730
Unless you disguise yourselves
as girls from here.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:18.070
No way.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:19.680
Absolutely not.

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.280
That makes things difficult.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.010
What about the night soil cart?

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:24.910
The night soil cart smells terrible.

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.680
They probably won't check it carefully.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.560
If you go with the cart,

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.020
you might slip out of town.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.079
I'll go look into it now.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.120
What if...

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.760
Don't you usually have many clever ideas?

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.520
Are we really going to
hide in that stinking cart?

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.490
There's no time.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.600
The meeting point has changed.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.329
Old Madam Wu and the others
don't know yet.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.190
I must leave town quickly

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.430
and find Old Madam Wu.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:57.430
Master.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.800
I've searched all the main roads
from the Xiao Residence,

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.730
but there's no sign of Old Madam Wu.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.870
I don't know where she is now.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.490
No need to search anymore.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.140
This Xiao Qiushui
always has unusual ideas.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.040
Even I was deceived about
Old Madam Wu's whereabouts.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.500
You won't find her either.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.829
It's my fault for being so slow-witted.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.390
What should we do next?

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.310
The Sword King's men
are all over the streets.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.310
I wondered why he

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.520
didn't confront me at Huanhua Sect.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.470
Turns out he was
setting an ambush out here.

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.670
He wants to reap the benefits in the end.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.409
But Xiao Qiushui
hasn't met with Old Madam Wu yet.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.680
Why is the Sword King so confident?

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.510
He's able to hold back his forces

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.310
yet specifically set up checkpoints here.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.770
This proves Xiao Qiushui's guess
was right.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.580
There must be another spy
close to Old Madam Wu.

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.370
All our spies have taken Misery Pills

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.330
and are registered in our records.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.180
Mr. Qiu is our only spy
in the Xiao Residence.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.690
That nameless person?

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.070
The Nameless Demon?

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:01.360
All these years,

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.800
among all the Sword King's people,

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.000
only this Nameless Demon

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.330
remains unidentified.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:08.960
You follow me in secret.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:10.850
Xiao Qiushui

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.560
will lead us to Old Madam Wu himself.

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.160
By then,

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.080
the Nameless Demon will surely appear.

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:22.000
I want to see who this person really is.

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:20.000
What's going on?

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.220
You took so long just to get some food.

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.200
People are searching everywhere outside.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.760
I had to be extra cautious.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.450
What's the point of writing down
these sects?

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:45.240
My mother said

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.650
these sects have good relations
with the Xiao family.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.260
After we send off Old Madam Wu,

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:54.820
I'll ask them for help.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.730
Righteousness always comes first
in the martial world.

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:02.040
I believe

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:05.360
they will help us.

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:12.200
Don't be too optimistic, Mr. Xiao.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.800
Throughout history,

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.000
people only pursue two things:

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.800
power and profit.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.240
Those with aligned interests
become friends.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.700
Currently, the Power Gang

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:24.610
can offer substantial benefits.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.140
So Huanhua Sect's friends

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:28.170
became the Power Gang's friends.

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:33.750
You're saying they'll stand by
and do nothing?

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:36.190
Everyone acts for their own interests.

00:07:37.159 --> 00:07:39.220
This martial world gathers for gain.

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:41.210
It's always been this way.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.070
No.

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:53.830
I used to read stories
about the martial world.

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:56.360
They had flashing blades,
revenge and honor.

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:59.750
But stories are just stories.

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:03.600
Now that I'm in this world,

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:06.510
this is exactly where I wanted to be.

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:12.630
There will always be some people
who fear nothing.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.260
They stand up for what's right

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:20.740
and fight for the weak.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.860
But how many people

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:34.350
are like that?

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.030
I don't know.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.870
But my father told me

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:55.320
even a tiny spark can start a blaze.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.080
Those with righteous hearts

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:01.080
will always find each other.

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:03.440
So that's why...

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:10.240
Chivalry is the foundation
of the martial world.

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:13.600
Let's make a bet

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:18.600
to see if this martial world
gathers for gain

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:20.270
or chivalry.

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:26.360
Fine.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:28.960
I'll bet with you.

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:30.810
What are you wagering?

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:32.360
The winner

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:35.030
can take one treasured item
from the loser.

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:36.030
A treasured item?

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:38.730
Just a suggestion.

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:43.120
I'm only trying to
use something intimidating

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.120
to wake you up.

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:47.430
If you don't like it,
we can choose something else.

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:49.480
No problem.

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:51.840
I'll take that bet,

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:53.950
but you're going to lose.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.080
I hope so.

00:09:58.750 --> 00:09:59.880
Third Young Master!

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:06.720
There's a problem.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.550
Zhang Si just told me the cart broke down.

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:11.080
He can't go out to dump
the night soil tonight.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.970
But we must leave town tonight.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.480
Hongxiu, how about this?

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:20.240
Go find me a black cloak

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:21.660
and get a carriage.

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:23.510
How do you plan to leave town?

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:24.870
Fight fire with fire.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.250
Since the Power Gang is looking for us,

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:30.840
why don't we pretend to be their members?

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:32.030
This...

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.120
Don't worry.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.270
What's your plan?

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.510
Tang Rou and the others
helped me write about

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.630
many famous figures in the martial world.

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:58.360
I've discovered that this Power Gang

00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.870
not only has many members,

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.050
but also has spies everywhere.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:03.840
They're not even united.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:04.960
So,

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:07.200
according to my deduction,

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.480
very few people know

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:12.320
how Li Chenzhou, Zhao Shirong,
and Liu Suifeng

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.450
actually look like.

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:15.390
What?

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:17.730
You want to be Li Chenzhou?

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:19.030
Wrong.

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:21.510
Li Chenzhou is too high and mighty.

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:23.310
How could he possibly come here?

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.840
I want to be Liu Suifeng.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:38.930
Hand it over.

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:52.150
If I remember correctly,

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.910
this Liu Suifeng also has a white fan.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.260
Let me borrow this.

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:10.840
But Liu Suifeng's subordinate,
Song Mingzhu,

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:11.900
just arrived here.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.500
Aren't you afraid she'll notice you?

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.790
I can tell your observation skills
are poor.

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:19.550
Who was chasing us

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.200
all along this journey?

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.790
Have you thought carefully about it?

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:24.000
The people hunting us

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.720
were wearing different colored clothing.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.090
Then who do you want me to impersonate?

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:32.910
Zhao Shirong.

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:33.840
No way.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.090
You're being difficult again.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.270
Why don't you pretend to be Zhao Shirong

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:40.000
and I pretend to be Liu Suifeng?

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:43.240
What's wrong with your memory?

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.960
You have a grudge with the Power Gang.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.440
You shouldn't show your face in public.

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.900
Just stay in the carriage
and don't come out.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:49.850
Don't worry.

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:51.840
I absolutely won't make you
dress as a woman.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.750
I won't make you
wear women's clothes either.

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:55.600
You've been in the martial world
for so many years.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.840
You must know something about them.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.610
Just don't mess things up
when the time comes.

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:04.870
Use the fan well.

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:20.590
[Lingliang Town]

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:22.750
[Annihilation Demon, Xinhu Hill]

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:28.150
Stop right there!

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:29.570
Didn't you hear me?

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:31.750
No one is allowed to leave town.

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:33.940
You bunch of dogs,

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:37.360
how dare you stop this carriage?

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:39.580
Who is speaking so boldly?

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:03.840
A plain fan with a five-petal orchid.

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:09.750
Could it be Deputy Chief Liu?

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.700
Is that the Chief's wife in the carriage?

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:22.840
Is that any of your business?

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:24.550
It's not that I don't believe you.

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:26.340
I just have orders
to guard this place.

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:27.600
I cannot be negligent.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.120
Few in our gang have ever seen

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:30.720
the Chief's wife and Deputy Chief Liu.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:35.480
Could you show me
the Deputy Chief's token?

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:38.070
You must be tired of living.

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:48.790
Years ago,

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.880
I once accidentally glimpsed

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:55.560
the back of the Madam in the gang.

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:03.850
How dare you

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.480
offend the Madam?

00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:08.980
I humbly dare.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.840
That was the Flowing Cloud Sleeve?

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:21.840
It really is the Chief's wife.

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:22.770
Get out of my way.

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.250
I deserve to die.

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.380
Everyone, step aside!

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:31.960
Bow.

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:43.990
Thank you.

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:47.200
If you meet Miss Hongxiu again,

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:49.680
please return this garment to her.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:50.270
Alright.

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.600
We must first thank you, sir.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.200
Otherwise, who knows

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:55.600
how long we'd be trapped

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:56.860
in Lingliang Town for?

00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:59.390
Sir, we'll take our leave now.

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:00.510
Farewell.

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:10.550
Mr. Xiao, let's get going too.

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:14.740
I just saw you seem to have used

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:17.600
Zhao Shirong's
Flowing Cloud Sleeve technique.

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:19.550
You know how to do it too?

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.730
It's just some tricks to scare people.

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:24.720
Haven't you always called me Lucky Bag?

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.920
I ought to know some rare tricks, right?

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:29.600
It's getting late. Let's go.

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:35.930
Does Feng Lang know this much?

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:38.330
Never mind.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.150
Meeting with Old Madam Wu is more urgent.

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:43.410
I wonder if Yiren has reached Guangling.

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:45.360
Once this matter is settled,

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.490
I'll tell Yiren to bring Shinian back.

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:49.530
He can also help Huanhua Sect.

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:53.650
You're so slow.

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:55.470
I thought you'd been caught.

00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:57.120
We had to use
quite some tricks to get out.

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.180
How did it go? Did you see Old Madam Wu?

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:00.270
I've been watching all day.

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:01.470
People came and went.

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:03.560
I only found Power Gang's minions.

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.000
Did you find our contact?

00:17:05.589 --> 00:17:06.510
He left a letter

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:07.640
and changed the meeting place.

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:10.170
He told me to bring Old Madam Wu
to the meeting.

00:17:11.109 --> 00:17:12.880
Where should we go now?

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:18.069
They must have left markers along the way.

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:19.829
If we find the marker,

00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:21.829
we might be able to find Old Madam Wu.

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:25.079
Let's go.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:04.130
Don't be afraid.

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:07.680
He passed out
because the poison reached his heart.

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.410
Fortunately,
he's regained consciousness now.

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:11.920
Thank you for your help.

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:13.810
Don't be afraid.

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:16.910
We're from the Huanhua Sect.

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:20.270
What exactly happened here?

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:23.200
They were making medicinal pills here.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.170
They forced us to test them.

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:27.690
If we refused, they would kill us.

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.960
If we obeyed and took their pills,

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.310
most of us

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:34.270
went mad

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:36.670
and died from poisoning.

00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:40.630
What kind of pills were they?

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:45.750
I only know that after taking their pills,

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.920
we felt neither tired nor hungry,

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.180
but we became violent.

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:52.520
It's indeed the Marching Pill.

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:55.750
Who were the people
that forced you to make these pills?

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:57.680
Could they be Northern Wastelanders?

00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:58.160
No.

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:01.200
They're from the martial world.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:05.440
I saw their tokens had a cauldron symbol
carved on them.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:06.740
A cauldron symbol?

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:08.790
Yiren,

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:11.050
could it be the Power Gang?

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.070
Are there any other survivors?

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:15.640
Well...

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.170
Don't worry.

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:20.070
My sister is a skilled physician.

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:21.790
She can definitely heal you all.

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:24.200
Miss, please save us.

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:26.590
Rest assured.

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:09.000
We should arrive
after walking a bit further.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:09.530
Let's go.

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:17.630
[Huanhua Sect Guangling Villa]

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:20.000
[Nangong Xiaoyi]

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.480
Yiren, Kaiyan, Xueyu!

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:23.310
Xiaoyi?

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:26.450
Xiaoyi, what brings you here?

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:28.240
I knew you all came to Guangling,

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:29.590
so I had to come see you.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.970
It's been over three years
since we last parted.

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:33.680
How are all the elders and siblings

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:35.280
in the Nangong family doing?

00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:36.920
They're all doing well.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.480
Yiren, you must be tired
from your journey.

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:49.750
If we can get to the bottom
of this Marching Pill matter,

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:51.610
this little hardship is nothing.

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.360
However, this case is indeed quite tricky.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.400
Let's go inside and talk.

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:04.400
Yiren.

00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:07.110
I think we should just drop it.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.350
In today's martial world,

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:11.280
who dares to offend the Power Gang?

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:15.180
If we keep pursuing this,
we'll bring trouble upon ourselves.

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:17.290
But Yiren came here

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:20.200
precisely because our family
has a responsibility to uncover the truth.

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:22.000
How can we back down from trouble?

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:22.680
Yes.

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:25.880
But knowing our limits isn't wrong either.

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:31.710
We should certainly view
the martial world's affairs as our own.

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:34.590
But this is the Power Gang
we're talking about.

00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:41.000
Yiren,

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.340
why don't we ask Father first?

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:48.480
The Marching Pill matter
is of great importance.

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:51.540
Making enemies rashly
will only harm the Huanhua Sect.

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:53.960
Then send a message by carrier pigeon
to Huanhua Sect immediately.

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:56.590
We'll make a decision
after consulting with Father.

00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:57.190
All right.

00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:10.350
-Third Young Master.
-Third Young Master.

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:11.240
How is everyone doing?

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:12.840
-Big Brother.
-Big Brother.

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:14.220
You're finally here.

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:16.640
We found that Lingliang Town
has been taken over by the Power Gang.

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:18.310
We had to settle in this rundown place.

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:20.160
We were worried you wouldn't find us.

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:20.920
I told you

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:22.880
Qiushui would never overlook my signal.

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:25.680
Why do you do whatever this person says?

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:27.740
You didn't even tell your sister.

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:29.920
Fang, I mean...

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:32.150
I trust your martial arts skills

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:33.880
and Big Brother's strategies.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.310
Didn't everything work out fine?

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:36.370
Enough, all of you.

00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:38.450
I got a letter from Tongfu Inn.

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:40.590
I need to see Old Madam Wu immediately.

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:41.400
Let's go now.

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:42.350
Qiushui.

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:47.200
Jiesheng and I just found this place.

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.330
Sorry for the delay.

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:49.690
Uncle Kang.

00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:59.490
Fortunately, Qiushui brought a message
from Lingliang Town.

00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:03.070
Otherwise, we might've missed the news
about this meeting.

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:06.200
How is the Xiao family doing now?

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:09.430
Once General Wu's troops arrive tomorrow,

00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:12.160
I'll seek help
from allies in the martial world

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:13.620
to rescue the Xiao family.

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:16.130
Please rest assured, Old Madam Wu.

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:18.320
I'll keep track of the time.

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:20.640
That's good then.

00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:23.160
Good.

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:27.500
Everyone who escaped from
the Xiao Residence has finally gathered.

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:30.000
Old Madam Wu.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:33.110
The letter says the meeting place
is not far from here.

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:34.400
It's already quite late.

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.200
Why don't we head there now?

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:39.070
Since it's not far
and everyone is exhausted from traveling,

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:41.000
we'd better rest for a while first.

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:42.960
All right.

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:00.160
Qiushui.

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:02.810
After tomorrow's matter is settled,

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:05.120
I will personally take you to seek help.

00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:07.610
Thank you, Uncle Kang.

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:12.270
Mr. Kang, Third Young Master,
the porridge is ready.

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:14.200
Take it to the people inside first.

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:18.140
How's this blade? Take a look.

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:21.880
Old Madam Wu, Mr. Zhang,

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.490
please have some porridge.

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:31.720
Mr. Zhang, thank you for escorting me
all the way. You've worked hard.

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:33.970
Thank you, Old Madam Wu.

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:52.680
Something's wrong with this porridge!

00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:08.440
Mr. Zhang!

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:09.410
Old Madam Wu.

00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:10.590
Are you all right?

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:11.310
I'm fine.

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:29.240
You've all been poisoned
with a muscle relaxant.

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:31.170
Let's see how long you can hold out.

00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:34.440
Uncle Kang, you...

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:35.900
This is hardly the time

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:37.360
to still call him "Uncle."

00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:42.460
You're quite the actor.

00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:44.560
You're from the Power Gang.

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:48.810
[Kang Chuyu]
[The Power Gang's Nameless Demon]

00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:52.830
All these years,
to solve problems for the gang,

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:55.830
I had to protect my reputation.

00:25:56.550 --> 00:25:58.480
I was treading on thin ice every day.

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:01.810
Otherwise, how could I have
let you take advantage of things

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:05.680
and even nominated you
as the young leader?

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:10.920
Xiao Qiushui, I must kill you today

00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:13.550
to vent the hatred I've been harboring.

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:16.170
Do you really think that the two of you

00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:17.400
can kill all of us?

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:23.380
Who said there are only two of us?

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:29.600
Watch out!

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:40.920
Take Old Madam Wu away first.
I'll hold them off.

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:41.450
Alright.

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:04.640
What's that?

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:06.580
Who is that demon on horseback?

00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:07.510
[Yan Guigui]
[The Power Gang's Iron Cavalry Demon]

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:09.550
That's Yan Guigui, the Iron Cavalry Demon.

00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:10.680
He's nothing but a beast.

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:11.880
He shows no humanity.

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.620
Protect Old Madam Wu well.

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:40.500
Zuoqiu, Yuhan!

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:55.890
Old Madam Wu.

00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:57.420
It's Song Mingzhu.

00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:58.810
She stole Old Madam Wu's bundle.

00:28:58.810 --> 00:28:59.720
I'll go after her.

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:00.320
Feng Lang!

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:02.350
Young hero, don't chase her!

00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:06.390
The Hero Command Token is actually kept in
the Nirvana Case.

00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:07.880
She won't be able to open it.

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:08.880
Once opened,

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:11.960
the gold-melting water inside
will dissolve the Hero Command Token.

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:14.960
There has been too much bloodshed
along this journey.

00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:16.490
The Hero Command Token...

00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:18.220
Let it dissolve.

00:29:25.270 --> 00:29:28.230
Old Madam Wu,
your safety is what matters most.

00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:30.930
Big Brother, I'll go after them.

00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:33.490
Be careful.

00:29:39.550 --> 00:29:40.360
Shorty?

00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:44.010
There are actually two people
inside Yan Guigui's armor?

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:47.170
I've been the legs for 10 years.

00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:49.030
Thank you for killing my brother!

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:50.630
I can finally be the head now!

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:54.030
Brothers, protect Old Madam Wu well.

00:29:58.360 --> 00:29:59.890
Are you two going to kill me?

00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:01.400
Are you looking down on me?

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:02.000
Yep.

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.530
You seem far weaker than your brother.

00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:42.840
Let's go.

00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:09.740
Old Madam Wu is our priority. Let's go.

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:15.880
Master.

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:29.070
It is indeed the Nirvana Case.

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:29.960
Just as I glimpsed earlier,

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:31.890
this is exactly what it looks like.

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:33.560
Forcing this box open

00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:35.110
will destroy the Hero Command Token.

00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:36.720
Old Madam Wu is
the mother of a great general.

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:37.780
If we threaten her,

00:31:37.790 --> 00:31:40.050
she will never tell us
how to open the box.

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:42.270
So you're planning

00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:44.800
to trick Old Madam Wu
into opening it herself?

00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:48.480
Master!

00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:55.050
I injured myself.
It has nothing to do with you.

00:31:55.050 --> 00:31:56.710
No matter what happens later,

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.530
you must not show yourself.

00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:12.120
Don't move!

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:12.890
Old Madam Wu!

00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:13.770
Zuoqiu!

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:20.240
Old Madam Wu,

00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:23.070
my son and I
finally managed to lose Zhang Linyi

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:24.030
and came here.

00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:27.320
And now you tell me
the Hero Command Token is gone?

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:28.200
Should I...

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:31.680
Kill another person

00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:34.510
to help you think carefully?

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:35.720
You!

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.160
Kang Chuyu, stop!

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.200
-Big Brother!
-Fang!

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:52.000
Kang Chuyu,

00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:54.050
you're truly despicable.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.860
My father has known you for years,

00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:59.110
yet he misjudged you.

00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:00.240
Tell me,

00:33:00.790 --> 00:33:03.110
what did the Power Gang offer you?

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:07.790
I was already the Power Gang's demon
long before I became famous.

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:11.310
I've just been hiding my identity.

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:12.790
No one bribed me.

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.820
So you're the Nameless Demon!

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:17.720
Nameless yet famous.

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:20.170
Whoever the gang needs me to be,

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:21.640
that's who I am.

00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:23.750
Too afraid to have a name,

00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:25.830
yet pretending to be a hero for years.

00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:26.830
How pathetic.

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:29.480
Say what you want.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.930
I only want the Hero Command Token.

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:36.680
Where is it?

00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:38.640
Where is it?

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:40.550
Tell me where it is now!

00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:41.410
Stop shouting.

00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:43.480
Song Mingzhu took the Hero Command Token.

00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:45.590
She abandoned you
to claim the credit herself.

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:47.390
The Nameless Demon, Kang Chuyu,

00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:50.210
will be known
throughout Jiangnan by tomorrow.

00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:51.340
Not necessarily.

00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:54.240
If you all die here today,

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:58.750
I'll remain nameless.

00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:00.620
Kang Chuyu,

00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:03.280
still defiant in the face of death?

00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:08.480
Then I'll kill your friend first.

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:09.110
No!

00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:11.670
Wait!

00:34:14.250 --> 00:34:17.050
Here's the Hero Command Token.
Don't hurt anyone.

00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:21.989
You're wounded?

00:34:23.239 --> 00:34:24.040
It's nothing.

00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:32.219
Feng Lang!

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:36.159
Catch!

00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:51.030
Fang!

00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:00.070
Big Brother!

00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:21.930
Tang Rou!

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:22.730
Fall in line!

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:24.930
-Old Madam Wu, I’m late.
-Old Madam Wu.

00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:25.600
Tang Rou.

00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:29.320
Tang Rou!

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:29.930
Tang Rou!

00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:33.150
Tang Rou.

00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:37.030
Jiesheng!

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:42.110
Don't let these two villains escape!

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:43.760
Fire!

00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:54.150
Father,

00:35:54.590 --> 00:35:55.320
run!

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:56.710
Run!

00:35:57.110 --> 00:35:57.710
Jiesheng!

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:02.320
Go!

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:21.920
Tang Rou.

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:23.440
Tang Rou.

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:24.920
Tang Rou.

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:25.880
Fang.

00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:28.320
Big Brother.

00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:36.760
Mr. Feng.

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:40.650
Big Brother.

00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:41.790
How is Feng Lang?

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:43.410
He must be treated quickly.

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:49.440
Tang Rou, Tang Rou!

00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:50.790
-Tang Rou!
-Tang Rou.

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:51.670
Tang Rou.

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.840
Old Madam Wu, please save Rou.

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:04.960
Old Madam Wu,

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:08.640
Tang Rou's heart meridian
has been severed by the sword energy.

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:10.000
He's beyond saving now.

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:32.090
Big Brother.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:35.630
Tang Rou.

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:39.920
Tang Rou.

00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:45.280
Fang.

00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:48.760
Fang.

00:37:54.110 --> 00:37:55.480
Why are you so foolish?

00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:57.920
Why did you take that hit for me?

00:37:59.030 --> 00:37:59.630
Fang.

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:04.070
I'm happy I could

00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:08.160
save my friends.

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:16.720
I'm just sorry for making you angry again.

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:19.400
You...

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:25.100
