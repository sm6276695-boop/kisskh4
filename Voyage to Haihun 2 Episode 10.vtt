00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.420
(Kangcheng construction site,
Yuzhang Commandery)

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.190
Hurry up.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.400
Move.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:43.510
Keep up.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.900
Lord Luo.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.440
Keep up.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.920
- Lord Luo.
- Hurry.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.560
You came in person.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.170
(Luo Xin, Inspector)
It is my greatest honor.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.350
I am merely here
for a routine inspection.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.070
Much obliged.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:59.820
Milord.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.040
This is what I wrote
to you about earlier.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.280
These lowly folk dared
to lay hands on me.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.040
One of them is called Qi Liuhai.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.240
His manner was most insolent,

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.490
showing no respect for the law

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:12.840
and no regard for Haihun at all.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.140
He's utterly unruly and reckless.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.360
Which one of you attacked him?

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.260
Lord Sun,
I need you to verify something.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.280
Hey.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.260
Why does Lord Luo
look at Sun Liao like this?

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.300
Even if his identity is concealed,

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.240
the pull of bloodline still holds sway.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.160
So, you are the famed Qi Liuhai.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.880
I am Di Zhonghai.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.150
I am the real Qi Liuhai.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:45.780
I don't care who you are.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.190
Take them to mend the road.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.800
If you can't fix the road properly,

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.380
I'll make you regret it.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.080
Alright, yes, yes.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:55.570
- Take them away.
- Move!

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.870
Go on, what are you staring at?

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.950
Hurry up, move along.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.200
Keep up.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.950
That little official's got
quite an attitude.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.530
- Stay calm.
- Get to work.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:14.630
Lord Sun.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.070
We follow
the Commandery-Vassal Parallel System.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.920
Keep moving.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.460
The Magistrate's backing is Lord Luo,

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.150
so his rank isn't far from that of you.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:25.260
If he's met you,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.550
- he'd know at once.
- Faster!

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:27.510
Then we can't hide it.

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.650
But clearly, he's never met you.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.010
- Move.
- Yes, milord.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.400
Since he doesn't know you,

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.470
we can quietly investigate.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.680
Still have time to chat, huh?

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.280
- Get to work.
- Sure.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.220
Big guy, head over there
and move those stones.

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.280
You two, go over there
and carry the mud.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.360
Hurry up.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.530
Li, Li!

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:46.300
You alright?

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:47.940
Quit dawdling and pick up those stones.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:48.950
What are you staring at?

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.090
- Move!
- Pick them up!

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.020
Sir.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:08.780
When did you come here?

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.530
How much money do you earn?

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:13.540
We're working so hard.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.380
We should get paid.

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.230
Given the situation,

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.200
I fear there's more to it than it seems.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.300
Exactly.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:31.350
Hey.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.120
What are you two dragging your feet for?

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.310
What are you two digging here?

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.160
Go dig over there.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.000
Go.

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:49.030
Heng.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.160
Ha ha ha.

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.600
A leopard never changes its spots.

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.040
That's going too far.

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:00.400
It's fine.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.290
I don't make a living
by my looks anyway.

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.400
You go work over there.

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.950
You head over there.

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:09.230
Go.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.120
Ha ha ha.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.880
You really can't see, can you?

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.120
Truly so.

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:21.600
You brought this on yourself.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.300
What are you staring at?

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:27.670
Get to work now.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:31.010
Hurry and get to work.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:32.470
Go work.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.190
Old man, hurry up.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.560
Don't slack off.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.840
Put in more effort.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.320
More strength, come on, move it!

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:55.490
Come on, put your back into it.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:57.810
Faster!

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:00.310
Come on!

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.200
Oh.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.490
Isn't that Di Zhonghai?

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.400
Hold it.

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:10.620
Don't block the way.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.370
What do you want?

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.190
Those able should take on more.

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:15.240
Use this to carry it.

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:20.030
Guards!

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:24.170
Milord.

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:25.880
How have you been managing
the oversight?

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:27.300
Add more for me.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.520
Yes.

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.980
So light and easy.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.700
Like ants moving their house.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.640
Give him more.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.360
He's just an old, useless man.

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:58.530
He can't move this.

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:00.490
Hurry up.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:04.840
- Faster!
- Be careful.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:06.560
Thanks.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:08.290
We help each other.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.800
Once on this site, it's hard to get out.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:11.680
True.

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:13.120
This road...

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.490
I just don't get it.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.070
Why keep tearing it up
and fixing it again?

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.830
You don't know.

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:19.890
If they don't keep at it,

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:22.410
how would the lords earn their money?

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:23.990
Come on, back to work.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:34.340
Sir.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:36.950
Work must be paid.

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:39.680
You toil so hard every day.

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:41.430
Why don't you take your money?

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.970
Working for the Marquis,

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.940
who'd dare ask for money?

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:49.850
The Marquis is so terrifying

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:52.000
in your eyes?

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:54.150
More than terrifying.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.720
He's just a jinx.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:56.630
Truly detestable.

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:58.160
Enough talking.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.070
We can't eat
or sleep well here every day,

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:02.280
and we don't get any money.

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:04.360
It's maddening. I'm going to sleep.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.420
He feeds on people's lifeblood.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.140
Not even a scrap of bone remains.

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:10.470
So many people

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:13.040
have lost their lives because of him.

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:17.760
Are you alright?

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:22.800
I'm fine.

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:30.040
Truly, I'm fine.

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.200
Marquis...

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:44.760
Over there.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:47.860
I've found something new.

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:48.950
Come here.

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:51.680
I'm fine.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:57.240
I'm fine.

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:07.360
This place is indeed strange.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.200
How so?

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:09.870
It was a proper road.

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:12.180
Yet they dug half of it up to rebuild.

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:14.930
Now, only one carriage
can pass at a time.

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:17.800
Clearly, someone's profiting from this.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.000
And quite a lot, too.

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:21.340
They keep doing it over and over.

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:22.350
Repairing again and again.

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:24.320
Each time asking for more funds.

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:26.970
Well.

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:30.110
It's my fault for not checking it.

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:31.300
My fault.

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:34.530
What do you mean?

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:35.560
Tell me in detail.

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:37.970
Well...

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:39.550
This really is...

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:42.320
Hurry up.

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:44.470
Hurry.

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:46.430
Move it, no slacking.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:48.560
Quickly, quickly.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.280
Work harder.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:56.680
Use more strength.

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:16.810
All of you, get to work.

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:18.750
No food if the work's not done.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:26.830
You fool.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.140
Utterly foolish.

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:30.280
You can't even handle
something so simple.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.320
Yes.

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:32.330
I am a fool.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:33.670
So what if I'm foolish?

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.010
Go on, keep scolding.

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:36.200
Still daring to talk back?

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:38.390
- Go on.
- I'll beat you down.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:39.320
I...

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:41.670
Milord, rest assured.

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:43.810
We'll get the job done.

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:46.630
Good.

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:48.120
Madman! Madman!

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.120
Get to work now!

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.100
What are you staring at?

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:54.110
Hurry up!

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:56.840
He's not wrong.

00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:59.240
I can't do anything well.

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:02.320
But there's one thing you can do well.

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:05.340
And only you

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:06.790
can do this.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:16.840
Quickly!

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:19.600
Work harder!

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:22.000
- Colonel.
- Faster!

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.020
Such a weary journey.

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:24.690
- You must be tired.
- No slacking!

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:26.230
I've prepared the finest feast,

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:27.200
awaiting you

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:28.700
to grace us with your presence.

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:30.510
This way, please.

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:32.630
This way, right this way.

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:35.860
Milady, take your time.

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:37.120
Milady, this way, please.

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:39.460
What are you staring at?

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:40.860
Two days later,

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:42.860
Mistress's important cargo
will pass through here.

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:44.080
Pick up the pace.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.440
Get to work.

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:47.010
Colonel.

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:48.090
Colonel.

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:51.420
What do you mean?

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:52.840
A secret.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:54.920
A secret?

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:57.720
Crouch down.

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:01.040
Let me sum it up.

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:02.610
Please, go on.

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.840
Lord Luo lied about the road repairs.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.440
Do we have solid proof of this?

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:08.910
We have it all in hand.

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:12.440
He said Mistress
has important goods coming in.

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:15.530
Could that mean someone
of a higher rank is coming too?

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.010
Maybe that person

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:21.080
is the so-called Mistress.

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:23.410
Are our guards ready?

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:24.800
Lady De Jiu has arrived.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.360
That means our people are in position.

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:27.920
Just waiting for the order.

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:29.960
Let's end everything.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.320
What are you lot lazing around here for?

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:33.630
Get up and get to work!

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:35.460
Move!

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.420
You, too.

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:41.620
Work faster.

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:42.950
Keep watch.

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:46.990
Hurry!

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:52.890
Keep your eyes on them!

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:54.580
Stop.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.670
Everyone else, leave.

00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:58.600
This young lady stays.

00:12:58.750 --> 00:12:59.590
Get moving.

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:02.200
Hurry, hurry, move!

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:08.270
This shipment looks pretty important.

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:10.610
I'll distract them in a bit.

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:13.830
You go check what's inside.

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.750
Be careful, Lord Wang.

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:16.910
Why don't you go instead?

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:18.630
I'm too heavy to run fast.

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:21.600
Alright, enough.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:23.680
Come here.

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:25.590
Young lady.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.530
Such slender hands you have.

00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:29.400
They're not meant for heavy work.

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:32.940
If you're willing to follow me,

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:36.570
I'll see you well-fed and cared for.

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.020
Just tend to me properly.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.080
Alright?

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:44.150
Lord Wang, we're outnumbered.

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:45.210
We must not act rashly.

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:46.330
I can't stand this.

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.270
I don't take anything by force.

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:50.760
As long as you agree...

00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.540
How dare you?

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:01.630
Harassing a young lady
in broad daylight.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.520
Lord Luo, such audacity you have.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.170
Guards!

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:19.630
Mishenfu.

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.000
I'll kill you!

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.190
How dare you ruin my plans!

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:23.030
Take them down!

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:25.690
Drag this woman into my tent.

00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:27.630
Milord, look behind you!

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:30.030
Insolent commoners.

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.500
How dare you touch
Mistress's sacred items!

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:33.530
Seize them!

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:39.900
Move!

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:42.810
You two again.

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:47.160
You're so domineering.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:48.390
You ruined the people's peace.

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:50.720
Tell us who's behind you.

00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:54.240
You have no right to question me.

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:55.970
Do I have the right?

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:58.180
I am

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.030
Liu He, Haihun Marquis.

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:04.170
You?

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:05.300
The Marquis?

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:07.960
Let me tell you this.

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:11.000
Even if Liu He came today,

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:13.400
he could do nothing

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:15.370
to me.

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:18.710
Fine.

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:22.030
Brothers, this official has no virtue,

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:23.640
borrows power from others' might,

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:24.700
and fills his own pockets.

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:26.660
He's torn countless families apart,

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:28.780
forcing all to suffer bitter toil.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.630
He's truly lost all conscience.

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:33.440
Let's take down this greedy official

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:34.560
and return home.

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:35.880
Let's act together!

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.440
Ask them.

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:41.790
Will they listen to you?

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.310
Who among you dares?

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.060
What are you looking at? Keep working.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:49.840
Come on.

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:52.000
Take me down.

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.080
Alright?

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:55.480
Where's De Jiu?

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:56.830
Come, milord.

00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:58.100
Come on, take me down.

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:00.490
No one would dare to touch me.

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:02.410
No one.

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:04.080
- Listen to me.
- She's here.

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:05.560
Crushing you is easier

00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:07.400
than crushing ants.

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:08.250
- Got it?
- Stop!

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:20.630
Colonel.

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:21.910
What does this mean?

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:23.670
Sorry

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:25.030
for being late.

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:27.790
Lord Luo.

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:29.780
Here she comes.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:32.130
Colonel.

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:33.410
Who are they?

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:35.020
They are Liu He, Haihun Marquis,

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:36.860
Wang Heng, Imperial Guard Commander,

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:38.530
and Sun Liao, Governor of Yuzhang.

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:40.650
Who dares be insolent?

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:43.980
Spare me, milord!

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:45.450
Please, spare me!

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:46.630
Lord Luo.

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.540
I can do nothing to you,

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:51.120
huh?

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:52.100
I'm doomed.

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:53.990
I'm doomed this time.
