=The Queen of Attack=

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.324
=Episode 11=

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.640
You don't look well.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.840
How about letting me check your pulse?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.120
You can read the pulse?

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.280
That's great!

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.960
Her Highness will take you
into the mansion.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.560
Find a way to lose
those Xu family followers.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.160
Return to the capital
and enter the mansion.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.080
Your condition isn't ordinary.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.520
Father, Mother,

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.960
that gentleman said I'm unwell.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.600
He wants to treat me inside.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.600
What?

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.336
You...

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.880
Are you out of your mind?

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.440
Father! Mother!

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.264
I don't care! I'm going anyway!

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.760
You're asking for trouble!

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.440
Disgraceful girl.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.160
Get back here!

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.240
My dear,

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.400
don't hit her!

00:01:34.016 --> 00:01:35.264
Something's wrong. After them!

00:01:41.171 --> 00:01:43.324
(Posthouse)

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.640
Mother,

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.720
why don't we live
in a mansion like this?

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.640
No! I want to live here too!

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.280
Alright!

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.720
(Luo Family's testimony)
This is the Luo family's testimony.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.000
I thought they came to clear my name.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.360
Turns out they fabricated
false testimony.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.160
They claimed I'd been estranged
from my parents.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.320
They said I disobeyed my family

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.960
and accused me of plotting patricide.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.560
They were crucial witnesses.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.400
Without their testimonies,

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.040
your conviction
wouldn't have been secured so fast.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.160
Uncle,

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.520
Aunt,

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.040
Qing,

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.720
my apologies.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.360
I forgot about you before.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.720
How did the Luos enter the mansion?

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.600
Indeed.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.000
It should be okay, right?

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.160
This escape attempt

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.520
was meant to
pressure the County Princess

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.120
into formally recognizing me.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.200
Didn't she already

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.400
bring your family here?

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.160
That counts as acknowledgment.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.920
Let's get back to the mansion first.

00:03:11.776 --> 00:03:12.280
Come on.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.520
This one is delicious.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.280
Truth be told,

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.480
frankly speaking,

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.480
when I first heard your story,

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.408
none of us

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.360
believed it.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.200
That shameless Hong'er...

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.200
Ziyi.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.960
Hong'er...

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.760
Hong'er is her childhood name.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.880
What's good about her?

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.320
She's not ladylike at all.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.360
When I

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.320
arranged her marriage to Mr. Sun,

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.600
her father groveled in gratitude.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.840
She was unmarriageable otherwise.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.360
Tell me. How can she compare

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.480
to our Qing?

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.000
Look.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.880
Beautiful as blossoms,

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.280
divine as a goddess,

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.280
skilled in song and dance.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:15.440
Look.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.520
Take a look!

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.200
How could she possibly attract

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.280
nobility like you?

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.480
How can we possibly feel no hatred?

00:04:33.536 --> 00:04:34.080
Father,

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.960
you're drunk.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.960
Stop drinking.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.080
I'm not drunk.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.000
Father.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:39.760
I'm not drunk.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.440
Not drunk.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.000
You're back.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.000
I'm not drunk.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:50.960
I'm not drunk.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.800
Uncle.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:57.360
Hong'er?

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.880
No.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.080
- Uncle.
- It's Ziyi.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.920
Ziyi?

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:00.920
Then you're Hong'er?

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.720
Hong'er.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.640
Hong'er,

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.920
you've changed?

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:05.440
Hong'er.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:06.360
Hong'er.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.240
I'm back.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.200
Hong'er.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.200
I won't rest even as a ghost

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.640
until I make your family pay.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:23.720
I've wronged you.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.240
I've wronged your family.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.040
Uncle, you've drunk too much.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.920
- You're drunk.
- You've drunk too much.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.720
- Aunt.
- Father, you're drunk.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:31.800
Help him back, hurry.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:32.800
I've wronged you.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.400
Come on.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.800
- I've wronged you.
- You're drunk!

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.600
I've wronged you.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.080
Who are you really?

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.520
Why won't you look at me?

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.400
I'm not.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.240
From our very first meeting,

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.440
you've avoided looking at me.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.400
Your Highness,

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.880
what exactly do you want?

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.680
I don't know.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.240
I don't know what I want to do.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:16.480
I don't know.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.840
But these crazy thoughts

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.560
keep popping into my head.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:41.920
What's wrong?

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.120
Aren't you crazy?

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.240
The child in my womb

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.840
should sober you up now.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:53.480
Move.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:56.640
Move!

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.800
Do you want to drag us all to death?

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:18.624
Well...

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:20.880
I just want money.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.080
You want money?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.720
Didn't my father pay you?

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.520
Your father did pay me,

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.600
but now that I'm in the mansion,

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.560
my price naturally goes up.

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:35.320
Price goes up?

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.240
Fine.

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:43.280
I'd like to hear your new demand.

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:47.560
Five thousand taels.

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:48.480
Are you insane?

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.000
Where would I get that much?

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:54.592
Well...

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.840
If your family can't afford it,

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.880
how did you distort truth to sacrifice

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.840
so many innocent lives

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.360
and sit high as the Princess Consort?

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:03.880
Shut up!

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:04.400
Well...

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:10.600
Fine.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.800
I agree.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.760
Give me fifteen days.

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.320
I'll write home

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.240
to have my father send the money.

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:22.440
Fifteen days?

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:24.960
Very well.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.520
Then we'll stay here those fifteen days.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.360
When the money arrives,

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.720
we'll leave immediately.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:33.312
You...

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.600
These are nice.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:41.960
Stop!

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.040
Alright.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.160
This dress doesn't suit you anyway.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.560
Qing would suit it better.

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.640
I'm leaving. Thanks.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.360
(I need to eliminate
this threat quickly)

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.480
(before complications arise.)

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.320
- Look!
- See these?

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.800
These are all fine stuff.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:17.480
Mother,

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:18.440
look!

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:19.800
The fabric,

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.360
and the embroidery...

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:22.920
So exquisite.

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:24.360
Indeed.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.600
Father, Mother,

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.400
don't you think

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.040
if I dress like her,

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.280
people wouldn't tell us apart?

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:39.560
Well...

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:41.440
Father,

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:42.640
haven't you always said

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.640
had Master Xian met me first,

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:47.480
I'd be the Princess Consort now?

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.480
I think Qing's no less than her.

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:56.200
Yes,

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:56.840
exactly.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.160
Your Highness.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:16.640
Your Highness?

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.000
You fool!

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:21.480
You fool!

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:22.560
You fool!

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:23.600
You fool!

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.480
How dare you seduce His Highness!

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:27.520
You fool!

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.920
How dare you seduce His Highness!

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:29.480
You fool!

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:36.800
What are you

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.240
doing?

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:39.968
I...

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.040
What are you doing?

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.480
Your Highness, save me!

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:46.520
She hit me!

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.928
- I don't know what I did wrong.
- What's all this?

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:54.160
What's going on here?

00:10:59.040 --> 00:10:59.680
Do you know

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.320
that framing someone to death

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.400
makes accomplice and instigator
equally guilty.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:04.400
Both must die.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.040
She was trying to silence me!

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:07.720
I didn't!

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.080
Silence her?
