00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.320
Nian insisted on going out.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.120
We couldn't stop her.
She went to West Street.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.480
Go pick her up.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.120
Look.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.400
- What a lunatic!
- I drew this.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.760
I drew this.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.600
Look at this.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.640
What a crazy woman!

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.000
I drew this.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.880
I drew this.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.680
Isn't she the Zhous' adopted daughter

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.880
who caused that big scandal?

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:29.800
It really is her.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.960
How did she end up like this?

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.440
Naturally,

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.680
she must be kicked out

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.040
due to many evil deeds.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.600
And she couldn't handle the shock.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.680
(Mom, where are you?)

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.720
(I want to go home.)

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.520
(I want to go home.)

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.080
(I want to go home.)

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:52.760
(Mom.)

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.720
Look, these paintings are mine.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.240
These are mine.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.120
Get away!

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.200
Look!

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.240
Get lost!

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:10.680
Is she okay?

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.960
She got hit by a car.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.480
(Mom,)

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.440
(I finished the painting.)

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.440
(Can I keep being)

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.840
(your daughter?)

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.720
What should we do?

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.280
What's happening?

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.240
Let me through.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.480
Probably beyond saving.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.400
She's already dead, right?

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.120
She dashed out on her own.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.280
I couldn't brake in time.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.120
Just tell the truth

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.320
to the police.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.720
She probably can't be saved.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.360
What a pity.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.600
She could've just backed off
and be the heiress.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.840
Karma's justice, I suppose.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.640
Why bother with a madwoman?

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.080
But it's still a human life.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.960
How tragic!

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.560
Disperse!

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.440
- Move!
- Step back!

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.320
Make way.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.080
Stay calm.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.920
Step back.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.800
- Lu.
- She's dead.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.360
Take her back first.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:56.640
Okay.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.840
(They can't take Nian!)

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.040
I'll check over there.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.080
Stay here and watch her.

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.920
Lu.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.080
Be careful.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.200
You three.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.240
Take the corpse back.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.160
Tell Lu Ye, I'm waiting for him.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.560
(Nian,)

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.360
(I will take you home.)

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.360
(Everyone who stands in our way)

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.160
(is destined to die.)

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.320
Nian, don't be afraid.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:29.680
He Jiu.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:31.960
You know me?

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.680
I live just to kill you.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.920
I won't let you die so easily.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.680
Zhao Qing! Zhao Qing!

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.560
What happened?

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.880
He Jiu.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.080
Lu.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:02.920
It's He Jiu.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:05.920
Come on.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.640
Bear with it.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:23.560
Lu,

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:24.800
He Jiu

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.800
took Zhang Wange south.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:28.880
Go quickly!

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:31.720
Wait here for me.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:32.680
I'll save you.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:00.760
Come on.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.240
Come on.

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.200
Come on!

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:54.840
Wange!

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:57.360
Nian.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.760
(You could have taken me back)

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.480
after I came of age.

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:04.520
At least

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:06.640
I could have had a real family.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.680
Why did you do this to me?

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.960
Why did you do this to me?

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.000
Don't touch me!

It was my fault

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.800
for not bringing you home.
