(To Ye Haitang)

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:45.600
Yu Nian.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.079
Thank you.

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:48.960
You may leave.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.880
Is it from your dad?

00:01:13.795 --> 00:01:16.672
(Tang Yixun)

00:01:22.879 --> 00:01:24.879
Is your dad named Tang Yixun?

(If...)

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.120
How is it? Are you cold?

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.439
Help me up.

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:11.000
I can't even stand up.

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:12.919
I'm frozen stiff.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.840
Frozen stiff?

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:15.960
You insisted on coming.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.439
What if you catch a cold,

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:19.199
or get scared?

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.000
Indeed. I might catch a cold.

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:22.960
But I get scared?

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:23.960
Impossible.

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:25.639
I've seen everything.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.759
We've waited all night,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.120
yet nothing comes

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:30.039
from the mailbox.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.199
What does Yu Nian mean?

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.919
What's the wrong with this mailbox?

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:37.960
So spooky.

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:40.719
Look.

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:42.120
Nothing.

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.280
It doesn't occur every night.

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:45.599
Depends on the situation.

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:47.159
Listen to me.

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:48.039
You go back first.

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:49.159
I'll keep watch for you.

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:50.800
I'll tell you once letters come.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.580
Then you come back.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.199
Well...

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.840
I'll go take a nap.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.199
Message me anytime.

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:00.479
Give out
missing person notices tomorrow.

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:01.560
Three hundred.

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:02.479
Okay.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.639
Keep watch.

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:07.240
A stray cat?

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:11.639
What's that noise?

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:17.039
It occurs.

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:37.360
I told you.

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.759
Are you okay?

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:46.199
Shen Cheng.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.240
We got a reply.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.879
What does it mean?

00:03:55.136 --> 00:03:58.368
(My kid, let's go to Shiqiao today.
For fish cakes.)

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.120
Are you sure

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.399
only you and your mom knew that phrase?

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:34.319
Yes.

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:38.560
Which means

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:42.720
that must be Ye Haitang from 1991.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.480
Yes.

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:53.360
My mom is still alive.

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:57.040
She lives in the year 1991 over there.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.439
300 missing person notices

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.319
were all

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:14.360
posted up.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.639
Exhausted.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.839
Listen up.

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:17.920
When I came back,

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.199
that woman was still there.

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:20.120
Listen,

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.240
your friend

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.079
is really something.

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:23.519
She's pregnant,

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:24.680
but not fragile at all.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:26.680
Though she likes to brag,

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:28.120
claiming she's bold.

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:29.800
But when the letter came,

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.120
she passed out from fright.

00:05:31.519 --> 00:05:32.439
Passed out?

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:33.439
Is she okay?

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:34.240
Is the baby alright?

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.720
Yes. I took her to the hospital.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.480
The doctor said...

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.040
Are you sure?

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.079
She just got scared. Okay.

00:05:38.079 --> 00:05:38.879
The baby is fine.

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:40.040
Are you crazy?

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.360
Why tell others about this matter?

00:05:43.959 --> 00:05:44.839
What do you mean?

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:47.160
Aren't we in the same team?

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:49.240
Shen...

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.040
Shen Cheng!

00:05:57.079 --> 00:05:58.079
What's wrong with him?

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.439
Why slammed the door?

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:03.720
Weren't you calling us

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.120
scammers?

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.639
Now you're worried about leaks?

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:07.800
How ridiculous!

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.639
Why slammed the door?

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:11.759
Where's your manners?

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:14.040
My mom says it would get bad luck!

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.759
Enough.

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:15.519
Mind your manners.

00:06:15.519 --> 00:06:16.639
Don't blame him.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:17.519
What's wrong?

00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:18.560
Is he your boss?

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.160
His mom's gone.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.040
Where to?

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.240
She's passed away.

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:25.160
Don't blame him.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.199
Dead?

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:30.639
I'm sorry.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.040
I'm really sorry.

00:06:33.959 --> 00:06:34.800
I didn't know.

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:37.160
Why didn't you tell me?

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.199
I noticed he was acting different.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.519
Losing his mom must be heartbroken.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.120
Alright. Stop it.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:47.920
Wait,

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.560
we just received a letter.

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:52.120
19 years old.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:53.920
That must be his mom.

00:06:54.839 --> 00:06:55.639
Cheng.

00:06:56.319 --> 00:06:57.120
Don't be sad.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:57.920
Come out.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:06:59.920
She's still alive.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.199
She's living in the other world.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.000
Stop it.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.720
Come out and discuss

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.879
how to reply the letter.

00:07:25.926 --> 00:07:30.848
(Avoid him now.)

00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:34.839
What does it mean?

00:07:34.839 --> 00:07:37.199
(He'll put you in danger.)
He'll put you in danger?

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:38.959
Give me.

00:07:38.959 --> 00:07:39.519
I'll write.

00:07:40.319 --> 00:07:41.279
Give me the letter!

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:42.279
Shen Cheng!

00:07:43.439 --> 00:07:43.759
What?

00:07:43.759 --> 00:07:45.439
Shen Cheng, explain yourself!

00:07:45.439 --> 00:07:46.639
That letter isn't just yours.

00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:47.399
Calm down.

00:07:47.399 --> 00:07:48.000
Shen Cheng!

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:49.040
Careful.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:49.639
Stop!

00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:50.160
Careful.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.160
Shen Cheng!

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:53.639
Keep your voice down.

00:08:06.839 --> 00:08:07.439
Ma'am.

00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:08.680
Don't provoke him.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.639
Let him write what he wants.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.240
Don't delay important matters.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.400
(Police)

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.079
This is where you used to live.

00:08:29.399 --> 00:08:30.360
Do you remember?

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:40.639
Yes.

00:08:41.279 --> 00:08:42.080
I used to live here.

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:44.120
We went to investigate.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.159
Some old neighbors

00:08:45.159 --> 00:08:46.600
remember your current father.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.480
He returned a year before you moved.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:53.960
A year before?

00:08:57.559 --> 00:08:58.360
That's him, right?

00:08:59.879 --> 00:09:01.679
That's my father when he was young.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.360
His name is Tang Yixun.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:05.720
In 1991,

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.639
he was imprisoned for manslaughter.

00:09:07.879 --> 00:09:09.200
Due to good behavior,

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.399
he was transferred to

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.440
Yu Zhiyong's prison for hit-and-run.

00:09:12.799 --> 00:09:14.200
They became cellmates

00:09:14.879 --> 00:09:16.200
and grew very close.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.039
Later, Yu Zhiyong

00:09:18.559 --> 00:09:19.480
fell ill

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.799
and died in prison.

00:09:21.879 --> 00:09:23.399
I think he received

00:09:23.399 --> 00:09:24.799
Yu Zhiyong's dying wish

00:09:25.279 --> 00:09:26.399
to go to your hometown

00:09:27.039 --> 00:09:28.519
and care for you and your grandma.

00:09:35.159 --> 00:09:35.960
Just...

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:42.759
Just because of a dying wish?

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.799
This seems the most likely reason.

00:09:46.279 --> 00:09:48.120
But first, we need to find him.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.559
We found his identity.

00:09:49.559 --> 00:09:50.679
That simplifies things.

00:09:50.919 --> 00:09:52.080
We'll contact you

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.039
once we have updates.

00:09:53.159 --> 00:09:53.480
Okay?

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.840
This mailbox stays,

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.159
while people come and go.

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.679
Everyone who sits here freezes up.

00:10:31.159 --> 00:10:31.919
Bro.

00:10:32.919 --> 00:10:33.600
Put this on.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:34.799
You'll catch a cold.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.960
Yu Nian told me everything.

00:10:43.159 --> 00:10:43.919
Sorry to hear that.

00:10:45.039 --> 00:10:46.399
I don't know how to comfort you.

00:10:48.559 --> 00:10:49.440
You must have

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.000
gone through a lot.

00:10:54.399 --> 00:10:55.360
I won't ask further

00:10:55.559 --> 00:10:56.679
to spare you more distress.

00:10:59.279 --> 00:11:00.159
Go back soon.

00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:00.840
It's freezing.

00:11:01.879 --> 00:11:03.120
Do you know Yu Zhiyong?

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.320
Do you know Yu Zhiyong?

00:11:15.399 --> 00:11:16.600
Fairly well.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.759
We interacted for months.

00:11:19.399 --> 00:11:20.600
What kind of person is he?

00:11:21.759 --> 00:11:22.399
He?

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:23.759
An old man.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.159
An old folk.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.159
He sat here every day.

00:11:28.799 --> 00:11:29.440
Quite stubborn.

00:11:30.559 --> 00:11:31.399
Just like you.

00:11:32.399 --> 00:11:33.840
He brought me steamed buns twice.

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:36.039
I think

00:11:36.879 --> 00:11:37.720
he's a good person.

00:11:39.639 --> 00:11:40.440
It's freezing.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.600
You should go back soon.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:44.000
Bye-bye.

00:12:13.248 --> 00:12:15.631
(Ye Haitang's personal information)

00:12:19.161 --> 00:12:24.896
(Middle school, Dropout)

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.639
He sat by the mailbox all night.

00:12:28.879 --> 00:12:30.159
Just sat there wide-eyed.

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.240
I worried he'd freeze.

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:34.600
How do you guys handle the cold so well?

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:35.960
I'll go check on him.

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.000
He doesn't let me reply now.

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.600
What if he gets a reply?

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.360
I'll join him.

00:12:43.159 --> 00:12:43.679
Coming.

00:12:44.279 --> 00:12:44.799
Coming.

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.879
You'll break the door.

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:49.679
Bro.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:52.960
Got a reply?

00:12:54.679 --> 00:12:55.399
Freezing cold?

00:12:55.559 --> 00:12:56.159
Thank you.

00:12:56.399 --> 00:12:56.879
No problem.

00:12:58.799 --> 00:12:59.519
Where to?

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.039
What happened?

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:02.799
Leaving now?

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:07.919
He just left?

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.080
How could he just leave?

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:10.840
Wait.

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:11.919
Where are you going?

00:13:12.159 --> 00:13:13.000
I'll follow him.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.639
Police only tells him

00:13:14.639 --> 00:13:15.600
about updates.

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:16.159
I need

00:13:16.159 --> 00:13:17.200
to follow him.

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:18.399
He doesn't tell you?

00:13:18.639 --> 00:13:19.879
He's immediate family.

00:13:20.799 --> 00:13:21.879
I'm at a disadvantage now.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.080
Inform Miaomiao for me.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.279
I'm leaving Beixing to you.

00:13:25.639 --> 00:13:26.539
Leave it to you, Quan.

00:13:26.759 --> 00:13:27.279
I'm leaving.

00:13:29.679 --> 00:13:30.200
You got this!

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:30.759
Wait...

00:13:31.039 --> 00:13:31.399
You...

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.519
Leave it to me?

00:13:36.919 --> 00:13:38.039
Can I handle it?

00:13:38.039 --> 00:13:38.840
Well...

00:13:40.399 --> 00:13:42.279
Such a huge responsibility.

00:13:53.799 --> 00:13:55.080
I'll handle it.

00:15:29.559 --> 00:15:30.360
This time,

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.279
why did you come back?

00:15:36.399 --> 00:15:37.679
I know your concerns.

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.519
I have one goal,

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:44.440
to find my dad.

00:15:45.559 --> 00:15:47.879
If he's done something wrong,

00:15:48.879 --> 00:15:50.159
I won't protect him.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.200
My mom's resume shows

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.399
she quit senior year

00:15:59.008 --> 00:16:00.544
and didn't take the college exam.

00:16:01.399 --> 00:16:02.120
I'll find people

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:03.639
who knew about this.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:05.720
Which year?

00:16:06.208 --> 00:16:07.808
The year Tang Yixun committed the crime.

00:16:12.159 --> 00:16:13.039
Did you find anyone?

00:16:16.448 --> 00:16:17.664
(Unknown caller)

00:16:20.039 --> 00:16:20.440
Hello.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:21.759
Hello.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.279
Are you Ye Haitang's son?

00:16:24.639 --> 00:16:25.759
This is Tan Xin.

00:16:28.639 --> 00:16:31.080
Ye Haitang

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.799
was hindered by that case.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.639
Tang Yixun's case?

00:16:37.279 --> 00:16:38.639
Ye Haitang was involved too?

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:42.440
The town had all kinds of rumors.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.000
Some said

00:16:44.559 --> 00:16:47.279
Tang Yixun killed for Ye Haitang.

00:16:47.559 --> 00:16:48.799
Others claimed

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.919
Ye Haitang did the killing,

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.399
and Tang Yixun took the blame for her.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:56.639
Anyway,

00:16:56.879 --> 00:16:57.720
I'm certain

00:16:58.960 --> 00:16:59.679
Tang Yixun

00:17:00.559 --> 00:17:02.399
would never harm Ye Haitang.

00:17:03.879 --> 00:17:06.240
Why are you so certain?

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.799
They were my students.

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.319
When Tang Yixun was in prison,

00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:13.960
he wrote me a letter.

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:18.039
Said he couldn't burden
Ye Haitang anymore,

00:17:18.759 --> 00:17:21.119
or tarnish her life further.

00:17:21.759 --> 00:17:23.960
He begged me to help her
retake the twelfth grade.

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:26.000
Make sure she can get into college

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.839
and leave Meiwan safely.

00:17:30.039 --> 00:17:31.519
After she got into college,

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:34.039
then we lost contact.

00:17:34.359 --> 00:17:34.960
Well,

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:37.200
about that case,

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:39.440
do you recall any other details?

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:41.079
Time.

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:43.519
It should be

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.200
November,

00:17:46.039 --> 00:17:47.400
around the end of the month,

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.000
30th.

00:17:49.319 --> 00:17:51.559
Do you know the deceased's name?

00:17:51.839 --> 00:17:53.319
Someone mentioned his name.

00:17:54.839 --> 00:17:56.359
But it sounded unfamiliar to me.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.759
So I forgot over time.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:17:59.799
My apologies.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:00.680
Don't mind it.

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:03.839
Please think carefully

00:18:04.759 --> 00:18:06.000
if there is anyone else

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.799
who was close to them.

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:08.599
For example,

00:18:09.039 --> 00:18:10.440
friends, family members,

00:18:10.759 --> 00:18:12.400
or classmates from their class.

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:13.480
Anything.

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:13.920
Anything.

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:14.559
Whatever works.

00:18:15.279 --> 00:18:16.000
Xun

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.599
was an orphan.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.599
He had a buddy named Zhang Hao
since childhood.

00:18:22.759 --> 00:18:24.160
I saw him a few years ago.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.160
Not sure if he's still in Pushui.

00:18:27.559 --> 00:18:28.359
His contact...

00:18:28.359 --> 00:18:28.799
Yes.

00:18:28.799 --> 00:18:29.440
Do you have it?

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:30.880
Well, I need to look for it

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:31.680
when I get home.

00:18:32.079 --> 00:18:33.599
I'll send it to you if found.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.680
Great, thank you.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:36.759
Thank you.

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:37.920
Grandma!

00:18:38.599 --> 00:18:39.279
Grandma!

00:18:39.799 --> 00:18:40.799
Xixi.

00:18:41.519 --> 00:18:42.720
Xixi is here.

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.920
You got a red flower award?

00:18:45.359 --> 00:18:46.559
Look, Grandma.

00:18:47.359 --> 00:18:49.039
Hello, you two.

00:18:49.599 --> 00:18:50.400
Hello.

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:52.799
- Mom.
- Son.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:54.920
This is my son.

00:18:55.279 --> 00:18:55.599
Hello.

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.400
Miss Tan,

00:18:58.599 --> 00:19:00.680
sorry for taking up your time.

00:19:01.079 --> 00:19:01.680
Thank you.

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.160
Not at all.

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:04.440
Here's our address

00:19:04.559 --> 00:19:05.640
and our contacts.

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:06.000
Right.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.039
If you recall anything else

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:10.200
or find Zhang Hao's contacts,

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.359
please tell us.

00:19:12.359 --> 00:19:13.599
Contact us anytime.

00:19:13.599 --> 00:19:13.960
Okay.

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:14.799
- Anytime.
- Okay.

00:19:14.799 --> 00:19:16.079
I will.

00:19:16.279 --> 00:19:16.960
Thank you.

00:19:17.039 --> 00:19:17.720
- Bye.
- Thanks.

00:19:19.319 --> 00:19:20.240
Let's go, Xixi.

00:19:23.559 --> 00:19:24.000
Let's go.

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.440
Now you know my dad isn't a bad person?

00:19:40.079 --> 00:19:41.880
It doesn't matter anymore.

00:19:44.759 --> 00:19:45.359
I want to know

00:19:45.359 --> 00:19:46.759
what they went through back then

00:19:46.759 --> 00:19:47.920
that they became like this.

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:51.799
If everything hadn't happened,

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:53.880
would it have been different?

00:19:59.799 --> 00:20:00.599
(Ye Haitang.)

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.480
(I'm your son Shen Cheng.)

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:07.319
(I don't know
how to describe my feeling now,)

00:20:07.839 --> 00:20:10.000
(or explain what's happening.)

00:20:10.599 --> 00:20:12.200
(But please believe what I say.)

00:20:12.759 --> 00:20:14.039
(In 2026,)

00:20:14.039 --> 00:20:15.759
(something terrible happened.)

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.440
(I want to know in 1991,)

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:18.640
(if you are doing well.)

00:20:19.079 --> 00:20:21.160
(Is there someone
named Tang Yixun around you?)

00:20:21.759 --> 00:20:23.119
(Whatever your relationship is,)

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:23.680
(please)

00:20:24.279 --> 00:20:25.119
(avoid him now.)

00:20:25.599 --> 00:20:27.079
(He'll put you in danger.)

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.200
(Believe me, Mom.)

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:30.400
My son?

00:20:31.359 --> 00:20:32.680
You have a son?

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.279
Why am I involved?

00:20:35.599 --> 00:20:36.799
Why must you avoid me?

00:20:36.799 --> 00:20:38.480
Why did he say I'd put you in danger?

00:20:39.039 --> 00:20:40.079
How is that possible?

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:41.759
What does it mean?

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:43.720
Wait, who is this person anyway?

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:44.799
Why should we believe him?

00:20:44.799 --> 00:20:45.880
He claims he's your son...

00:20:50.799 --> 00:20:51.880
Your son's surname is Shen?

00:20:52.799 --> 00:20:53.920
So his dad is also a Shen.

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:55.799
Who's his father then?

00:20:56.519 --> 00:20:57.319
Shen Xiaojun?

00:20:58.079 --> 00:20:58.960
Impossible.

00:20:59.839 --> 00:21:01.400
You and Shen Xiaojun are at odds.

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:02.319
How is that possible?

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:03.640
Wait, where am I?

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:04.680
Am I dead?

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:05.759
Impossible.

00:21:05.759 --> 00:21:06.360
If I had died,

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:07.759
I wouldn't write you a love letter.

00:21:07.759 --> 00:21:08.559
They wouldn't write

00:21:08.559 --> 00:21:09.519
to let you avoid me.

00:21:09.759 --> 00:21:10.319
Wait.

00:21:10.319 --> 00:21:11.400
Let's calm down.

00:21:11.559 --> 00:21:12.839
The letter says

00:21:12.839 --> 00:21:14.440
your son's surname is Shen, Shen Cheng.

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:15.279
Told you to avoid me,

00:21:15.279 --> 00:21:16.279
I'd put you in danger.

00:21:16.279 --> 00:21:18.039
Why would we believe his words?

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:28.799
Didn't you say

00:21:29.039 --> 00:21:30.880
only you and your mom knew that phrase?

00:21:31.319 --> 00:21:32.480
Right.

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:34.200
Look, the handwriting matches.

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.960
So this was written by Shen Cheng.

00:21:36.119 --> 00:21:36.920
But there's no way

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:37.880
anyone else knows this.

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.279
I didn't even tell my grandma.

00:21:39.279 --> 00:21:40.319
Wait, does this mean

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.960
Yu Nian is your mother?

00:21:43.079 --> 00:21:44.200
My mom is Wu Fengying.

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.559
Wait, this is so confusing.

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:48.440
None of these names match up.

00:21:51.119 --> 00:21:52.640
They mentioned someone earlier...

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:54.279
Yu Zhiyong.

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:55.759
Who's this Yu Zhiyong?

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:57.039
No idea.

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:00.519
Then why did they

00:22:00.519 --> 00:22:01.319
write these letters?

00:22:01.599 --> 00:22:02.720
Told you to avoid me,

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:04.039
and I'd put you in danger?

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:05.599
What would happen

00:22:05.599 --> 00:22:06.519
to us in 2026

00:22:06.519 --> 00:22:08.240
has anything to do with us now?

00:23:14.519 --> 00:23:15.480
Put this inside.

00:23:28.799 --> 00:23:29.480
Tang.

00:23:31.599 --> 00:23:32.079
Tang.

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:36.599
The test papers...

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:37.680
It's fine.

00:23:38.559 --> 00:23:40.160
Just test papers. Let them be.

00:23:42.359 --> 00:23:43.200
What's wrong?

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:51.480
This house

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:55.200
leaks every time it rains.

00:24:10.559 --> 00:24:11.279
Xun.

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:15.480
It's okay. Really.

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:16.720
I'll rewrite them.

00:24:28.839 --> 00:24:29.839
Tang.

00:24:35.759 --> 00:24:36.400
I'm sorry.

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:38.880
Nothing.

00:24:39.119 --> 00:24:40.079
It's no big deal.

00:24:51.119 --> 00:24:53.079
I thought about it all night.

00:24:55.599 --> 00:24:57.440
I must've done something wrong.

00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:58.960
Nonsense.

00:24:58.960 --> 00:24:59.759
Think about it.

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:02.039
If I did nothing wrong,

00:25:02.039 --> 00:25:02.960
I'd be by your side

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:04.400
and they wouldn't make you leave me.

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:05.640
Don't overthink it.

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.839
We don't know what's happening.

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:10.519
Tang, I mean...

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:12.000
If one day,

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.480
I really put you in danger,

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:15.079
just run away if you can.

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:16.799
Time apart is nothing.

00:25:16.799 --> 00:25:17.480
If I'm alive,

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:18.680
I'll come find you.

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:21.079
You won't.

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:24.160
Once we figure this out,

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:25.680
we'll be safe.

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:30.400
Let's tidy up first.

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:43.359
Tang.

00:25:44.039 --> 00:25:46.000
I'll get more tarp from the market.

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:48.880
I'll go with you.

00:26:06.079 --> 00:26:06.839
The mailbox?

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:10.680
Where's it?

00:26:14.079 --> 00:26:14.880
Sir.

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:16.440
Sir.

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:17.480
Where's the mailbox?

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:18.480
Mailbox?

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:20.160
Isn't it there?

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:21.400
- It's gone.
- It's gone!

00:26:25.079 --> 00:26:25.960
Probably washed away.

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:26.680
What?

00:26:28.599 --> 00:26:29.039
Xun!

00:26:29.079 --> 00:26:29.880
No, no!

00:26:30.079 --> 00:26:30.920
Kid, get back here!

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:32.000
Be careful. It's dangerous!

00:26:32.319 --> 00:26:33.440
Xun, come up here!

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:34.319
Tang, don't get down!

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:35.960
Come up! Forget the mailbox!

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:36.839
Xun, come up now!

00:26:37.079 --> 00:26:38.720
Xun, come up here!

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:41.839
- Come up!
- Xun!

00:26:44.519 --> 00:26:45.799
Just let it be.

00:26:45.799 --> 00:26:46.920
Why risk your life for it?

00:26:47.279 --> 00:26:48.000
Tang.

00:26:50.559 --> 00:26:52.359
Be careful, Xun.

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.599
Careful.

00:27:35.519 --> 00:27:36.320
I'll go look for it.

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.039
It's raining heavily.

00:27:38.799 --> 00:27:39.559
Don't go out.

00:27:39.559 --> 00:27:41.200
I need to find that mailbox.

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:43.599
How can I reply without it?

00:27:44.079 --> 00:27:44.880
Why did the mailbox

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:46.160
suddenly vanish?

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:49.880
It's raining heavily.

00:27:50.839 --> 00:27:51.720
It's an accident.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.519
But the mailbox vanished!

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.559
I have to ask them

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:57.119
why they told you to avoid me

00:27:57.119 --> 00:27:58.680
and what dangers you might be in.

00:27:58.680 --> 00:27:59.480
I know nothing!

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:00.279
Xun.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.480
We can't figure out what happens

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:05.480
with just some words.

00:28:06.119 --> 00:28:07.720
Let's go look for it tomorrow.

00:28:09.079 --> 00:28:10.200
We won't be apart.

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:12.680
Never.

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:23.640
Okay.

00:28:26.279 --> 00:28:27.319
I'll look for it tomorrow.

00:28:29.079 --> 00:28:30.000
Every day.

00:28:31.519 --> 00:28:32.640
Meiwan is not that big.

00:28:33.359 --> 00:28:34.359
I believe I can find it.

00:28:57.799 --> 00:28:59.480
The Billiards is ready.

00:29:00.119 --> 00:29:01.640
And Cha is back on his feet.

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:04.079
Why doesn't Bao

00:29:04.079 --> 00:29:05.960
leave you alone?

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:09.880
What did Qiang tell you that day?

00:29:10.279 --> 00:29:11.759
You still go collect debts for them?

00:29:17.599 --> 00:29:19.079
As long as we don't work for them,

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.720
they can't control us.

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:30.000
Cha.

00:29:33.519 --> 00:29:34.400
The rain's stopped.

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:35.799
Take Zhenzhu home.

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:37.920
Don't come over lately.

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:40.039
Tell Xun the same.

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:42.480
We're different from them.

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:44.599
We can still avoid them.

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:47.799
Go.

00:29:55.456 --> 00:29:57.856
(Buddies Billiards)

00:30:11.119 --> 00:30:12.359
Qiang, the door is locked.

00:30:12.359 --> 00:30:12.960
No one's there.

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:15.839
This sign can only fool you.

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:17.920
You idiots.

00:30:20.544 --> 00:30:21.632
(Temporarily Closed)

00:30:28.759 --> 00:30:29.240
Fine.

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:30.759
Li Chadong.

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:34.839
Got guts.

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:36.680
Qiang.

00:30:37.759 --> 00:30:39.200
They're trying to defy us.

00:30:53.279 --> 00:30:54.960
Granny, I will restock for you later.

00:30:55.079 --> 00:30:55.559
Alright.

00:31:06.759 --> 00:31:07.680
Did Cha contact you?

00:31:15.599 --> 00:31:16.599
What should we do?

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.160
Just listen to him.

00:31:19.359 --> 00:31:20.599
Don't go over there lately.

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.440
If you see Qiang or Fat Dog,

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:25.599
avoid them.

00:31:25.799 --> 00:31:26.559
Avoid them?

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:28.559
For how long?

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:30.960
Shut down
both the Billiards and video parlor?

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:31.599
If we don't,

00:31:31.599 --> 00:31:32.839
we'd just earn money for them.

00:31:33.359 --> 00:31:34.240
Better do manual labor

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:35.039
than that,

00:31:35.039 --> 00:31:35.680
right?

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:39.319
What a curse

00:31:39.319 --> 00:31:40.559
to encounter those scumbags.

00:31:40.559 --> 00:31:42.519
We can't even

00:31:42.519 --> 00:31:44.160
get rid of them.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.039
Get rid of them?

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:49.599
Just smashing them.

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:54.920
Alright.

00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:55.839
Xun.

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:58.480
You go back to school.

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:01.200
I'll help Zhenzhu and Granny

00:32:01.359 --> 00:32:02.400
with the sweet soup shop.

00:32:03.279 --> 00:32:04.799
Let's get busy.

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:07.039
Things will be okay soon.

00:32:09.839 --> 00:32:10.240
Okay.

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:31.480
I hope it didn't hit you.

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:43.000
Hai.

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:01.680
Girl.

00:33:02.759 --> 00:33:04.680
Tell Rat and the others

00:33:05.039 --> 00:33:06.160
to be cautious.

00:33:06.359 --> 00:33:07.079
Otherwise,

00:33:07.279 --> 00:33:09.200
I don't know what's in these bottles

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.039
next time.

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:14.039
Reading?

00:33:14.039 --> 00:33:14.759
What do you want?

00:33:14.759 --> 00:33:15.240
Get out.

00:33:15.519 --> 00:33:16.319
Reading?

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:18.119
What do you want?

00:33:18.279 --> 00:33:18.799
Take it easy.

00:33:18.799 --> 00:33:19.680
Calm down, guys.

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:20.559
What's

00:33:20.559 --> 00:33:21.559
going on here?

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:23.880
Sorry, sir.

00:33:24.599 --> 00:33:26.599
We're friends with the cashier girl.

00:33:27.119 --> 00:33:28.279
We came to buy books.

00:33:28.279 --> 00:33:28.880
What's wrong?

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:29.920
Not welcoming me?

00:33:30.119 --> 00:33:31.200
I'm your friend?

00:33:31.519 --> 00:33:32.599
I don't know you at all.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.240
What?

00:33:34.519 --> 00:33:36.599
We're your boyfriend's buddies!

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:41.279
Leave now, or I'll call the police.

00:33:41.559 --> 00:33:42.759
Can't I buy books here?

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:43.960
Is it against the law?

00:33:47.759 --> 00:33:48.160
Come on.

00:33:49.079 --> 00:33:49.480
Go ahead.

00:33:51.039 --> 00:33:51.920
Tang! Tang!

00:33:55.319 --> 00:33:55.960
Let go.

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:56.759
Let go.

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:03.000
Right.

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:04.559
Hey, here.

00:34:05.039 --> 00:34:05.960
Buy some cigarettes.

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:06.920
Here.

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:08.000
Here.

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:08.679
Here.

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:12.760
Bro, here.

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:15.119
Buy your buddies cigarettes.

00:34:16.239 --> 00:34:16.679
Sorry.

00:34:16.679 --> 00:34:17.599
She is new here.

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:21.239
Come over.

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:22.079
Come over.

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:24.679
Look, he's

00:34:25.239 --> 00:34:26.079
really good at it.

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:27.159
Call the police?

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:28.199
Let me tell you.

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:30.159
I've got plenty of time.

00:34:30.599 --> 00:34:32.639
I can play with you every day.

00:34:33.119 --> 00:34:34.400
Look, are these books

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:35.679
interesting?

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:38.519
Get something more exciting.

00:34:38.519 --> 00:34:39.159
Okay? Tell me.

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:39.760
Yes.

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:40.800
Say it.

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:41.320
Yes.

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:42.119
I can't hear you!

00:34:42.119 --> 00:34:43.119
Yes. Yes.

00:34:43.679 --> 00:34:44.079
Good.

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:50.440
Call the police.

00:34:51.159 --> 00:34:51.840
Buy books.

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:53.079
Fat Dog.

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:54.480
Let's go.

00:34:54.719 --> 00:34:55.679
Like this one?

00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:56.920
What are you staring at?

00:34:57.679 --> 00:34:58.440
Want to get beaten?

00:35:14.239 --> 00:35:14.840
Sir.

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:17.239
I'm sorry.

00:35:19.679 --> 00:35:21.039
Don't believe them.

00:35:22.039 --> 00:35:23.440
I truly don't know them.

00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:25.920
You shouldn't mess

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:28.840
with them.

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:32.119
I'm sorry.

00:35:36.079 --> 00:35:36.760
Tang.

00:35:41.159 --> 00:35:42.119
It's a small bookstore.

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:45.440
My wife and Hu live here.

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:47.320
I-I believe you.

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:50.522
But I can't mess with them.

00:35:52.719 --> 00:35:53.519
They are barbarians.

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:05.719
Well, listen.

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:13.599
I-I'll

00:36:13.599 --> 00:36:15.639
give you this month's salary early.

00:36:17.079 --> 00:36:18.199
Take all of it.

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:20.079
You...

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:21.360
Should...

00:36:22.079 --> 00:36:22.679
Should...

00:36:22.679 --> 00:36:23.639
Focus on your studies.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:26.880
I'm sorry.

00:36:42.559 --> 00:36:43.480
Thank you, sir.

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:48.519
Thanks for taking care of me.

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:50.840
Sorry for causing you trouble.

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:58.039
I'm leaving.

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:40.960
Tang.

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:45.440
Why are you here?

00:37:46.039 --> 00:37:46.840
Aren't you working?

00:37:51.559 --> 00:37:53.079
I just came back.

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:55.920
What's up?

00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:59.440
Xun, is something wrong
at the Billiards?

00:38:01.559 --> 00:38:02.360
What do you mean?

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:07.320
Tang.

00:38:09.519 --> 00:38:11.119
Did you hear some rumors?

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:19.280
Some punks caused trouble
at the bookstore today.

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:20.679
Punks?

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:22.239
Know their names?

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:23.920
I don't know.

00:38:25.079 --> 00:38:25.920
Never seen them.

00:38:26.559 --> 00:38:27.440
They came for you?

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:31.039
Said they'll keep coming

00:38:31.639 --> 00:38:32.960
as long as I'm there.

00:38:36.039 --> 00:38:36.960
I know who they are.

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:38.480
Xun.

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:43.840
Are you in some kind of trouble?

00:38:50.239 --> 00:38:51.039
Tell me.

00:38:54.599 --> 00:38:56.159
We don't want to work for Bao.

00:38:58.304 --> 00:38:59.784
They want to take over the Billiards,

00:39:01.159 --> 00:39:02.159
and Cha didn't agree.

00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:05.840
I've been worried they'd cause trouble.

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:08.840
I was wondering with Rat

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.400
why they didn't make a move.

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:13.039
So they came to you.

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:15.239
Those scumbags!

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:17.599
Xun! Xun!

00:39:17.719 --> 00:39:19.239
Xun, calm down!

00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:21.039
Calm down.

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:25.599
They're trying to provoke you with this.

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:27.000
Don't fall for it.

00:39:28.599 --> 00:39:29.719
I can't put you in trouble.

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:31.440
I won't.

00:39:32.039 --> 00:39:33.400
They don't dare to come to school.

00:39:34.639 --> 00:39:35.599
If they dare,

00:39:36.079 --> 00:39:37.000
I'll call the police.

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:43.920
You finally get on the right track.

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:46.880
Don't ruin it because of me.

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:50.400
Promise me. Okay?

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:53.960
Promise me.

00:39:59.239 --> 00:39:59.960
Please.

00:40:04.719 --> 00:40:05.719
Don't worry.

00:40:08.039 --> 00:40:09.039
I won't act rashly.

00:40:10.239 --> 00:40:11.000
From now on,

00:40:11.119 --> 00:40:12.320
I go wherever you go.

00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:14.980
I'll protect you.

00:40:17.239 --> 00:40:17.960
Okay.

00:40:34.752 --> 00:40:36.384
(Temporarily Closed)

00:40:41.039 --> 00:40:41.840
Cha.

00:40:46.239 --> 00:40:47.559
You're finally back.

00:40:49.159 --> 00:40:49.960
Why are you here?

00:40:50.239 --> 00:40:51.440
When we came,

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:53.840
we saw this sign.

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:54.800
The door was locked.

00:40:55.039 --> 00:40:56.320
I was so worried about you,

00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:58.119
so we waited here.

00:40:58.440 --> 00:40:59.800
If you are in trouble,

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:01.519
we couldn't explain to Bao.

00:41:02.079 --> 00:41:04.280
You're Bao's favorite buddies.

00:41:04.639 --> 00:41:05.239
Perfect.

00:41:06.159 --> 00:41:07.719
Tell Bao this when you go back.

00:41:08.519 --> 00:41:09.840
I'm closing the Billiards.

00:41:10.239 --> 00:41:11.639
You think you can just quit?

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:12.840
What do you mean?

00:41:13.079 --> 00:41:14.400
Nothing.

00:41:14.639 --> 00:41:16.239
It's Bao's decision to make.

00:41:16.639 --> 00:41:18.360
Let's take it easy

00:41:19.239 --> 00:41:20.480
and not push us too hard.

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:23.239
Cha, I'm just delivering messages.

00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:24.599
Since you said so,

00:41:25.559 --> 00:41:27.079
I'll tell Bao about it.

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:31.920
Cha.

00:41:32.239 --> 00:41:34.079
You know Miss Tan pretty well, right?

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:37.280
What do you want?

00:41:37.719 --> 00:41:39.159
Nothing.

00:41:39.679 --> 00:41:40.320
Come on.

00:41:40.639 --> 00:41:42.079
I just want to ask

00:41:42.079 --> 00:41:43.920
if Miss Tan is single.

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:45.280
Bao has been

00:41:45.679 --> 00:41:46.960
worried no one

00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:47.840
likes Fat Dog.

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:49.320
Miss Tan is great.

00:41:49.519 --> 00:41:50.960
Young, in good shape,

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:52.400
gentle,

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:53.039
and kind...

00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:57.280
If you target her,

00:41:58.079 --> 00:41:59.239
I'll kill you.

00:42:01.559 --> 00:42:03.159
It doesn't matter,

00:42:04.599 --> 00:42:06.840
but there are so many of us here.

00:42:07.719 --> 00:42:09.079
You only have two eyes.

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:10.440
Can you monitor us all?

00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:26.519
Good.

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:30.039
We're buddies, right?

00:42:30.639 --> 00:42:32.840
Don't stay so hot-headed.

00:42:35.119 --> 00:42:35.920
Give me a hug.

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:44.639
Much better.

00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:46.159
Go back.

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:47.400
We're going back.

00:42:48.039 --> 00:42:48.920
Don't stay up late.

00:42:50.119 --> 00:42:50.639
Let's go.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.039
Exhausted.

00:43:00.239 --> 00:43:01.039
What?

00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:02.800
They went to the bookstore?

00:43:05.239 --> 00:43:05.639
Right.

00:43:07.559 --> 00:43:09.400
Ye Haitang can't
even work part-time now.

00:43:10.239 --> 00:43:11.039
Do you think

00:43:13.159 --> 00:43:14.440
they'll go to Zhenzhu

00:43:15.199 --> 00:43:16.239
or Granny?

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:18.159
Cha,

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:19.840
if this continues,

00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:21.519
Zhenzhu and Tang will both be in danger.

00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:24.639
You think Tan Xin is safe?

00:43:28.159 --> 00:43:29.159
They went to Miss Tan?

00:43:30.519 --> 00:43:31.519
Those scumbags!

00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:32.400
Cha.

00:43:33.039 --> 00:43:34.440
We can't just sit here.

00:43:34.639 --> 00:43:36.239
We have to do something.

00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:37.159
Say something!

00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:38.480
Can you be quiet?

00:43:39.239 --> 00:43:39.960
I'll handle it.

00:43:41.639 --> 00:43:42.400
Let me think.

00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:43.239
Okay?

00:43:45.559 --> 00:43:46.039
It's okay.

00:43:47.679 --> 00:43:49.360
Don't worry. I come frequently.

00:43:50.239 --> 00:43:51.519
I'll keep a close eye on it.

00:43:51.519 --> 00:43:52.000
Good.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.280
This can be sold for money.

00:43:54.159 --> 00:43:55.039
What are you doing?

00:43:57.920 --> 00:43:59.119
Who are you?

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:02.039
Who are you then?

00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:04.000
Security.

00:44:04.559 --> 00:44:05.119
Well,

00:44:05.559 --> 00:44:06.199
we're scheduled

00:44:06.559 --> 00:44:08.159
for demolition here next week.

00:44:08.679 --> 00:44:10.280
We need to clear it out now.

00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:11.480
No one informed you?

00:44:13.079 --> 00:44:15.000
Quan. Quan.

00:44:15.159 --> 00:44:16.039
Can you hear me?

00:44:16.239 --> 00:44:17.559
Go find Sun Miaomiao now.

00:44:17.679 --> 00:44:18.559
She has connections.

00:44:18.599 --> 00:44:19.039
Anyway,

00:44:19.039 --> 00:44:20.320
keep the mailbox for me, okay?

00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:23.960
Any papers?

00:44:26.199 --> 00:44:27.559
Our superiors didn't give us.

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:30.000
We require official papers.

00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:31.360
It's the regulation.

00:44:41.658 --> 00:44:45.504
(Yuetu 205)

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:48.400
Coming.

00:44:54.199 --> 00:44:55.000
Who are you?

00:44:57.880 --> 00:44:59.840
You're Tang Yixun's daughter?

00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:01.280
Yes.

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:03.599
And you are?

00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:06.840
Rat.

00:45:09.719 --> 00:45:10.559
You're Zhang Hao?
