00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.032
Mawin is joining our class starting today.

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:09.184
I will also send Mawin
to the qualifying exam for the math camp.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.824
Just seeing Mawin’s face,

00:00:10.832 --> 00:00:12.192
I already lost my confidence.

00:00:12.216 --> 00:00:14.032
Why don’t you seek advice from a fortune teller?

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:15.384
Ask him how you can defeat Mawin.

00:00:15.408 --> 00:00:16.420
Just get to the point.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.264
I have a fortune teller to recommend to you.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.808
His predictions are very accurate.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.328
It means you need to
make someone close to you fall for you.

00:00:23.352 --> 00:00:24.456
How can I make him like me?

00:00:24.496 --> 00:00:26.460
Just sharing the room with him
is already too hard.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.368
(Dark horse.)

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.648
(No matter how fast it can run.)

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.496
(If it wake up late,)

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.368
(it will fall behind other horses.)

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.728
Please enjoy your sleep until dusk.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.104
(In a competition, nothing is more important
than knowing your rivals.)

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.976
(Especially those who are hard to read.)

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.616
(They are the most dangerous ones.)

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.056
What the heck!?

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.632
He follows no one.

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.448
Morning, Err.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.512
Morning, Dan.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.872
What’s up?

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.240
Are you solving a math question
while walking?

00:02:44.288 --> 00:02:45.112
What math question?

00:02:45.136 --> 00:02:46.520
I’m scrolling through IG.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.864
Err, did you have breakfast?

00:02:53.896 --> 00:02:54.872
No, Plawan.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:56.912
Let’s go have breakfast.

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.000
He doesn’t even post his photo.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.560
He doesn’t even post his photo.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.248
Is this his finsta?

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.192
A guy like him has a finsta?

00:03:06.208 --> 00:03:07.296
It’s unlikely.

00:03:11.032 --> 00:03:11.728
Hey.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:12.808
You just came down now.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:13.344
Yes.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.560
You should hurry and have breakfast

00:03:14.592 --> 00:03:15.808
before the food runs out.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:17.816
Okay.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.488
Err.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:27.552
Shit.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:28.960
I’m sorry.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.848
I forgot to bring a toast for you.

00:03:30.888 --> 00:03:32.768
Do you know what happened yesterday?

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.264
Do you remember Ton?

00:03:34.288 --> 00:03:36.430
I barely got any sleep.

00:03:36.464 --> 00:03:39.216
He was crying to me until 3 am
because he missed his grandma.

00:03:39.264 --> 00:03:42.104
I told him to stop crying.

00:03:42.136 --> 00:03:44.536
He said he also missed the buffalo
that his grandma raises.

00:03:44.568 --> 00:03:47.272
He missed both of them.

00:03:47.312 --> 00:03:49.616
He has only 90ish friends on Facebook.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.576
The person you need to make fall for you

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.200
is Mawin?

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:58.280
How did you know that?

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.000
Benz told me about Seer TK.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.032
Benz told me about Seer TK.

00:04:03.912 --> 00:04:05.320
From what I saw yesterday,

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.720
are you sure it’s about Mawin?

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.936
Right? I’m not sure either.

00:04:11.352 --> 00:04:13.128
I think Benz’s guess is ridiculous.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.984
So is the fortune teller’s advice.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.288
How about this?

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.368
I usually don’t believe in this kind of stuff.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.672
But from what Benze told me,

00:04:20.696 --> 00:04:21.616
this fortune teller’s advice is spot-on.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.616
I guess so, or it could be just a fluke.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.616
I’m not sure either.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:29.992
Can I ask you for real?

00:04:30.016 --> 00:04:31.360
Apart from this,

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.568
do you have other ways to defeat him?

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.456
Where is Mawin?

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.736
When I went to have breakfast,
I didn’t see him either.

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:47.424
Is he still sleeping?

00:04:47.456 --> 00:04:48.848
The class will begin in five minutes.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.608
Just let him sleep.

00:04:54.688 --> 00:04:56.690
It’d be great if he wakes up at 3 pm.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.528
Are you crazy?

00:05:03.496 --> 00:05:06.480
I felt bad to see him crying
because he missed his buffalo.

00:05:06.512 --> 00:05:08.376
He was on his knees and begged me.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.688
I was comforting him until 3 am.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.680
Oh.

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.864
Didn’t you say he was sleeping?

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.848
Huh?

00:05:19.632 --> 00:05:21.200
Did he crawl through vents to get here?

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:23.920
How is this possible?

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:26.984
You must get it wrong.

00:05:27.016 --> 00:05:27.648
Let’s go.

00:05:45.192 --> 00:05:46.320
Okay.

00:05:46.368 --> 00:05:48.096
Do you see the difference?

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:49.984
On the left, he didn’t give the full process.

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.976
Showing your solution to the question
is very important.

00:05:53.008 --> 00:05:55.448
It doesn’t matter
if your explanation is short or long.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.768
But it needs to be…

00:05:56.792 --> 00:05:57.408
…complete.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.176
That’s right.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.888
I’ll give Sugus one point for this question.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:00.000
Meanwhile, Mangpor will get two points.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.760
Meanwhile, Mangpor will get two points.

00:06:01.776 --> 00:06:03.096
Good job.
Give them a round of applause.

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.264
Excellent.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.040
The next question is a bit harder.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.200
Try to solve it.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.640
Go.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.272
Can you solve it?

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.992
If you think you have the answer,
raise your hand.

00:06:22.368 --> 00:06:24.656
I’ll give eight points

00:06:25.128 --> 00:06:28.740
if you find the correct answer.

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:31.272
Hey.

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.456
The boy at the back wearing a grey hoodie.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:36.872
Did you solve the problem?

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.232
Can you solve it?

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:40.352
Yes.

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:44.816
Good.

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.368
Can you come out and show how you solve it?

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:06.584
Do I need to write it down?

00:07:06.616 --> 00:07:08.704
Just show how you solve it.

00:07:08.728 --> 00:07:10.048
It doesn’t have to be detailed.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:12.320
Are you sure he’s smart?

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:14.352
If he can’t do it, it will be embarrassing.

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:18.480
I can write it down.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.264
Can you help clean the board first?

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:25.488
Huh?

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:27.816
Bring it here.

00:07:27.848 --> 00:07:29.064
Okay.

00:07:31.344 --> 00:07:33.736
If that board doesn’t have enough space,
you can continue on this board.

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:43.848
Is your friend a monster?

00:07:45.008 --> 00:07:46.144
Damn.

00:07:47.392 --> 00:07:50.416
[Is Mawin the person close to you
mentioned in the fortune teller’s advice?]

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:51.408
[That’s what Mhee told me.]

00:07:51.456 --> 00:07:54.232
[Do you have to make him fall for you?]

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.656
[Damn.]

00:07:55.688 --> 00:07:58.504
[I know you can do it. You are the best.]

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:00.000
[I want to block you.]

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.072
[I want to block you.]

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:09.424
Err.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:10.016
What?

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:11.888
Why don’t you sit with him?

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:14.640
No.

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:17.296
What are you afraid of?

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:20.280
Seriously, do you want the scholarship?

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:21.896
If you don’t talk to him,

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.152
how will he fall for you?

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:24.744
Nonsense.

00:08:24.776 --> 00:08:26.864
Benz’s guess could be wrong.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.888
Whether his guess is right or wrong,
it doesn’t hurt to start a convo with him.

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:33.288
Try to befriend him.

00:08:33.336 --> 00:08:35.290
You are his roommate.

00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:43.944
Can I sit with you?

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:46.600
My friend skips lunch.

00:08:57.216 --> 00:08:58.600
(Get lost.)

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:04.216
I brought water for you.

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:14.928
When did you leave the room this morning?

00:09:14.968 --> 00:09:16.136
How did you arrive at the class before me?

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.140
I took a shortcut through the pool.

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:20.120
Is that route shorter?

00:09:20.136 --> 00:09:22.408
Based on the displacement, it’s much shorter.

00:09:26.168 --> 00:09:28.170
You did awesome earlier.

00:09:28.192 --> 00:09:29.416
Did you attend a tutoring class?

00:09:29.456 --> 00:09:32.160
Mr. Suea took a picture of your solution.

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:34.488
Do you know that?

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:37.432
Yes.

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:42.384
Excuse me.

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:09.376
Err.

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:11.208
What?

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:18.152
Why are you here?

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.440
They want to know about Mawin.

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.048
I’m not that curious.

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:24.616
Don’t overstate it.

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:28.640
Are you close with him?

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:32.480
Mawin is freaking smart.

00:10:32.512 --> 00:10:34.296
He can answer all my questions.

00:10:34.328 --> 00:10:35.600
But all he does is zone out in class.

00:10:35.632 --> 00:10:37.296
True. He’s a genius.

00:10:37.312 --> 00:10:39.424
Petch’s jaws dropped while watching him.

00:10:40.048 --> 00:10:42.050
I’m not close to him.

00:10:42.088 --> 00:10:43.056
He and I only go to the same school.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.016
Mr. Err.

00:10:44.056 --> 00:10:46.440
Your schoolmate is a real genius.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.952
He’s like a scientist.

00:10:48.536 --> 00:10:51.928
I think Mawin will be one of the top 3 this year.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.352
Not only the top 3,

00:10:54.384 --> 00:10:57.512
I think he will win the scholarship.

00:10:57.536 --> 00:10:59.760
At first, I thought Mangpor would get it.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:01.632
I’m Mangpor.

00:11:01.848 --> 00:11:03.000
Okay, Mangpor.

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:04.368
I’m Err.

00:11:04.408 --> 00:11:06.088
You are close with Mawin, aren’t you?

00:11:06.112 --> 00:11:07.616
You are his roommate, right?

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:09.968
Yes, we are roommates but…

00:11:10.008 --> 00:11:11.448
Then you know everything about him.

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:14.248
What does his study schedule look like?

00:11:14.288 --> 00:11:15.496
Which cram school does he attend?

00:11:15.528 --> 00:11:16.616
Who is his tutoring partner?

00:11:16.648 --> 00:11:17.848
Which textbook does he read?

00:11:17.864 --> 00:11:19.850
You need to tell us everything.

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.944
I only shared a room with him for one night.

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:24.152
And…

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:25.904
I don’t know…

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:26.864
I don’t care.'

00:11:26.904 --> 00:11:29.728
You need to find all the info about him tonight.

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:31.216
I’m not sure.

00:11:31.256 --> 00:11:33.016
I don’t want to pry into his personal business.

00:11:33.048 --> 00:11:34.128
You can’t do that.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.968
Don’t you see he is topping the chart for two days

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.992
even though he barely answers any questions?

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:50.880
[How do I start a convo with someone?]

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:54.200
[Start from getting to know that person.]

00:11:54.248 --> 00:11:57.216
[Find things that they like or enjoy.]

00:11:58.980 --> 00:11:59.992
Right?

00:12:00.016 --> 00:12:01.416
What does he enjoy?

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.472
Is he secretly working on math questions?

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:17.616
Is he listening to a lesson summary?

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:19.544
What are you doing?

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.336
[Should I forget about the mission?]

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.272
[I’m afraid that Mawin will find out
about the fortune teller.

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:09.056
[If he finds out, so what?
You won’t see him again if you get the scholarship.]

00:14:09.096 --> 00:14:10.064
[Why do you need to be scared of him?]

00:14:10.504 --> 00:14:12.500
[But he’s really scary, Benz.]

00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:17.744
[He’s a human like you.
Why are you so afraid of him?]

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:22.144
He’s so reserved and weird.

00:14:22.144 --> 00:14:24.140
It’s like he eats math questions
instead of meals.

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:26.560
Hey.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:30.536
Where is the kitchen?

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:32.368
I’m hungry.

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:41.224
Give it to me to put the pot on.

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:46.720
No, it might get a burn mark.

00:14:47.104 --> 00:14:48.688
Isn’t it just a rough notebook?

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:50.264
Can’t I use it?

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:53.376
Come on. It’s hot.

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:17.192
Say it.

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:19.688
What?

00:15:20.216 --> 00:15:22.220
Didn’t you try to start a convo with me
earlier today?

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:24.240
So talk to me.

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:34.264
Does your name have a meaning?

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:38.928
Yes, it’s a Mandarin word.

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:40.368
It means “two”, right?

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:42.048
Does your brother’s name mean “one”?

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:44.504
Yes.

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:45.976
My grandma gave us the names.

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:51.928
What about you?

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:53.480
Don’t you have a nickname?

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:56.904
My name is easier to pronounce
than Prik-Klua.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.192
What is the name of the boy with a broken arm?

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:07.480
Mara.

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.632
There are thousands of vegetables and fruits,

00:16:11.664 --> 00:16:12.968
but he is named Mara, as in bitter melon.

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:21.160
You are a genius.

00:16:21.192 --> 00:16:23.264
Everyone in the class complimented you to me.

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:27.600
I told you I know that.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:35.360
Don’t you want to eat it?

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:40.520
No, it has too much MSG.

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:41.688
If I eat it, I’ll keep feeling thirsty.

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.600
If you feel thirsty, then drink water.

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:46.168
If I drink a lot of water,
I’ll have to go to the bathroom often.

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.832
It’ll interrupt my focus while studying.

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:49.168
Is it that big of a deal?

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:54.992
I’m not a genius like you.

00:16:58.560 --> 00:16:59.696
I won’t eat it.

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:01.776
I eat only food that is beneficial for me.

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:06.784
If you eat it,

00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:11.488
I’ll tell you
what I’ve been listening to all this time.

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:16.840
Is this beneficial for you?

00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:34.040
Err.

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:38.776
Did you find out how your friend studies?

00:17:38.784 --> 00:17:40.520
What workbook does he use?

00:17:40.552 --> 00:17:42.040
Which cram school does he attend?

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:44.736
I don’t know.

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:47.168
He didn’t tell me anything.

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:48.752
How can you know nothing?

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:51.352
You’ve been with him for two nights.

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:55.392
Are you secretly studying like him?

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.392
No, why would I do that?

00:17:58.424 --> 00:18:00.000
He really didn’t tell me anything.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:00.480
He really didn’t tell me anything.

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.480
What were you talking about Mawin?

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.072
It was so loud that I could hear it from the door.

00:18:22.256 --> 00:18:23.160
CREATE AN EQUILATERAL TRIANGLE
WITH A COMPASS AND A STRAIGHTEDGE.

00:18:23.192 --> 00:18:25.848
(Many of you are worried about geometry.)

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.216
(Don’t worry.)

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.984
(If you know how to use a compass well,
you can solve any questions.)

00:18:31.248 --> 00:18:33.250
(A compass is your weapon.)

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:35.960
Mhee, I’ll go get my compass.

00:18:35.992 --> 00:18:36.568
Yeah.

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:43.472
I’m done using it.

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:24.672
You heard it, didn’t you?

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:26.912
My conversation with Mangpor.

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:29.448
I’m sorry.

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:39.648
About what?

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:42.656
I didn’t mean to do that.

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:44.064
Those guys complimented you to me.

00:19:44.088 --> 00:19:46.060
They asked me about your secrets
to doing well in class.

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:49.752
I wasn’t trying to be your friend
because I wanted to know your secrets.

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.120
I wasn’t mad at you.

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:55.344
If I were mad, I wouldn’t lend it to you.

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:56.312
Hey.

00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:58.880
Do you want to have dinner with me?

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:02.064
I’ll eat later.

00:20:02.104 --> 00:20:03.760
If I go now, other kids will feel uncomfortable.

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:06.280
Why do you need to care about them?

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:07.220
Just come with me.

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:09.704
I’ll eat MSG food with you.

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:14.368
I’m not hungry. I want to rest.

00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:34.424
[If I want to make up with someone,
what should I do?]

00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:40.192
[Find the thing that person wants
and give it to him.]

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:43.096
The thing that he wants?

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:51.608
Thanks.

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:52.440
Put it there.

00:20:52.464 --> 00:20:54.144
I’ll eat it after taking a shower.

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:02.140
I’m not bringing only your meal.

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:03.888
I bring two meal boxes.

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:09.840
Let’s eat together.

00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:23.176
♪ I can’t take my eyes off you ♪

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:27.160
♪ Ta da da da du ♪

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:31.200
♪ Du du du du du ♪

00:21:31.248 --> 00:21:34.752
♪ Du du du du du ♪

00:21:34.784 --> 00:21:38.552
♪ Today, you came to study with me ♪

00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:41.136
Make some noise.

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:45.024
Why are you frowning?

00:21:45.048 --> 00:21:46.432
Smile.

00:21:46.464 --> 00:21:50.776
We need to get vitamins from sunlight, too.

00:21:50.816 --> 00:21:53.520
Can’t we sit at our desk and study?

00:21:54.232 --> 00:21:56.232
This is so uncomfortable.

00:21:56.264 --> 00:21:57.848
It’s not uncomfortable.

00:21:57.888 --> 00:21:59.896
This class is very simple.

00:21:59.936 --> 00:22:00.000
You don’t need to do anything.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.792
You don’t need to do anything.

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:08.152
What I want you to do is set up teams of five.

00:22:08.184 --> 00:22:09.400
Start.

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:12.280
Teacher, teams of five.

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:12.920
Are we going to play games?

00:22:12.952 --> 00:22:14.128
How did you know it?

00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:15.920
It’s just my guess.

00:22:18.064 --> 00:22:19.552
It’ll be fun.

00:22:19.576 --> 00:22:20.080
Does it require swimming?

00:22:20.128 --> 00:22:20.888
I want to swim.

00:22:20.928 --> 00:22:21.832
The pool will be part of the game.

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:24.336
Really?

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:28.512
There are three of us.

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:30.200
We need two more.

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:32.080
Ton.

00:22:32.104 --> 00:22:32.776
Yes.

00:22:33.192 --> 00:22:34.192
Do you want to join our team?

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:35.728
Mangpor.

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:36.768
What about this team?

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:38.992
We’ll join you.

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:41.976
Mawin, hello.

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:45.616
This girl is so annoying.

00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:48.232
Alright, everyone.

00:22:48.256 --> 00:22:49.600
Today,

00:22:49.928 --> 00:22:53.280
this class is about easy basic math questions.

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:58.208
You’ll have 20 seconds to answer each question.

00:22:58.248 --> 00:23:00.000
In each round,
one of the team members will be a hostage.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.192
In each round,
one of the team members will be a hostage.

00:23:02.224 --> 00:23:06.176
If your team fails to answer in time,

00:23:06.224 --> 00:23:07.848
the hostage will go into the water.

00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:15.464
First, find who will be the hostage of your team.

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:17.392
The first hostage.

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:18.448
Who will it be?

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:25.464
Listen.

00:23:25.496 --> 00:23:26.888
20 seconds seems like enough time.

00:23:26.904 --> 00:23:27.896
But it’s actually not.

00:23:27.928 --> 00:23:28.920
It doesn’t seem like enough time.

00:23:28.952 --> 00:23:29.760
It’s a very short time.

00:23:29.784 --> 00:23:31.760
If you get the answer, just say it.

00:23:31.784 --> 00:23:34.144
Wait for another two votes supporting it
before answering.

00:23:34.152 --> 00:23:35.880
So we won’t get it wrong. Okay?

00:23:35.904 --> 00:23:36.808
That sounds good.

00:23:36.848 --> 00:23:37.680
What do you think?

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:41.616
With the time that we have,
we can only calculate it once.

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:44.840
We need to listen to the majority's votes.
Okay?

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:46.968
What if the votes are tied?

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:49.232
You have to find the answer too and tell us.

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:50.576
Yes.

00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:52.512
Let’s do it this way.

00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:53.792
What about our team’s name?

00:23:54.448 --> 00:23:56.792
Right. He told us to come up with a team name.

00:23:58.550 --> 00:23:59.864
Speedy math.

00:23:59.912 --> 00:24:00.000
Are you living in the Bronze Age?

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000
Are you living in the Bronze Age?

00:24:02.048 --> 00:24:03.536
Don’t you have a cool name?

00:24:03.568 --> 00:24:04.720
Quick math.

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:06.952
You don’t need to follow your boss every step.

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:10.960
You need to suggest a name, too.

00:24:11.176 --> 00:24:12.520
I have no idea.

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:15.240
You need to come up with a name, too.

00:24:15.272 --> 00:24:16.968
You’re our team’s ace.

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:23.888
I read this on the internet.

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:25.880
My love multiplies.

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:29.472
Does it sound too tacky?

00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:34.000
My love multiplies.

00:24:34.056 --> 00:24:36.232
It’s not divided?

00:24:36.256 --> 00:24:37.608
Cool name.

00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:41.664
Alright.

00:24:41.704 --> 00:24:45.104
The first team, My Love Multiplies.

00:24:45.136 --> 00:24:47.440
I’ll remind you again.

00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:50.816
You have 20 seconds for each question.

00:24:50.856 --> 00:24:51.456
Are you ready?

00:24:51.496 --> 00:24:52.424
Are you ready, the hostage?

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:54.016
Okay.

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:55.592
The first question.

00:24:55.632 --> 00:24:59.288
Three times log base 27 of 64 equals what?

00:24:59.296 --> 00:24:59.960
4.

00:24:59.992 --> 00:25:00.000
My answer is also 4.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:00.720
My answer is also 4.

00:25:00.744 --> 00:25:01.448
4.

00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:03.688
4.

00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:04.776
Correct.

00:25:04.808 --> 00:25:06.336
Good job.

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:08.712
You passed the first question.

00:25:08.736 --> 00:25:10.144
The second question.

00:25:10.192 --> 00:25:13.912
Sine 15 degrees plus sine 75 degrees
equals what?

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:15.312
√6 / 2

00:25:15.344 --> 00:25:16.264
√6 / 2

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:17.848
-√6 / 2

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:20.224
√6 / 2

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:21.816
√6 / 2

00:25:21.848 --> 00:25:22.768
Well done.

00:25:22.808 --> 00:25:23.664
Correct.

00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:25.296
Why can’t you say it faster?

00:25:25.328 --> 00:25:26.544
Right. Why didn’t you say it?

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:28.752
The next question, ready?

00:25:28.784 --> 00:25:30.168
The next question.

00:25:30.208 --> 00:25:37.776
The definite integral from -3 to 3 of
x2025 + x ,with respect to x, equals what?

00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:39.504
0?

00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:41.424
My answer is also 0.

00:25:41.464 --> 00:25:42.224
I don’t know.

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:43.408
0.

00:25:43.608 --> 00:25:44.080
Good job.

00:25:44.112 --> 00:25:44.920
Correct.

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:49.656
The last question.

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:54.168
The square root of 5 minus
2 times the square root of 6 equals what?

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.592
√3 - √2

00:25:56.670 --> 00:25:58.392
But my answer is √2 - √3.

00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:00.000
Isn’t it √3 - √2?

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:00.048
Isn’t it √3 - √2?

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:01.224
√3 - √2.

00:26:01.272 --> 00:26:02.350
Shall I answer?

00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:03.944
Wait. Let me calculate again.

00:26:03.976 --> 00:26:05.360
Mangpor, we don’t have time.
Just answer.

00:26:05.392 --> 00:26:07.384
It’s √3 - √2. Tell him.

00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:10.528
√3 - √2.

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:13.056
Correct.

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:15.552
You almost didn’t answer it in time.

00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:20.288
Well done.

00:26:20.336 --> 00:26:21.352
- Give them a round of applause.
- Ton.

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:22.872
You are safe.

00:26:22.912 --> 00:26:24.448
He almost didn’t make it.

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:25.584
Let me give you a hug.

00:26:25.616 --> 00:26:28.944
The next team, come here.

00:26:28.984 --> 00:26:31.136
The Unafraid of Division team.

00:26:31.176 --> 00:26:33.296
Ton, why didn’t you say it faster?

00:26:33.328 --> 00:26:33.896
We almost didn’t get it in time.

00:26:33.936 --> 00:26:35.536
They must read the same website as you.

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:36.832
What do you mean?

00:26:36.856 --> 00:26:38.280
Unafraid of division.

00:26:38.472 --> 00:26:40.280
You are teasing me again.

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:42.056
I don’t spend much time on the internet.

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:43.184
I believe you.

00:26:43.208 --> 00:26:44.864
This joke was played ten years ago.

00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:49.664
Did you see Ton’s face?

00:26:49.712 --> 00:26:51.368
His face went pale.

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:52.912
It was so funny.

00:26:52.928 --> 00:26:55.120
Mr. Mhee, can I sit with you?

00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:57.840
Mr. Ton, please have a seat.

00:26:57.872 --> 00:26:58.696
Thank you.

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:03.216
We are the “My Love Multiplies” team.

00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:06.336
Mawin, the name is dope and modern.

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:08.400
I won’t help you create a team name next time.

00:27:08.432 --> 00:27:10.400
Mr. Mhee, stop teasing him.

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:12.752
My dad used this joke
when hitting on my mom.

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:15.512
Your dad was so cool.

00:27:15.544 --> 00:27:18.200
Of course, he was cool.

00:27:18.232 --> 00:27:20.208
He was romantic.

00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:23.520
I think he’s as romantic as Mr. Mawin.

00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:25.544
Hey.

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:32.048
Did you have fun today?

00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:34.208
Yeah.

00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:48.368
We are now friends.

00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:50.472
I also had a lot of fun today.

00:28:30.624 --> 00:28:32.232
Can you solve this question?

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:33.712
You can do it.

00:28:38.576 --> 00:28:39.664
Anyone?

00:28:41.232 --> 00:28:43.230
Be confident. Raise your hand.

00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:50.176
NO.8 ANANTACHAI KRAIKAEW

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:57.048
Have you had the answer?

00:29:02.650 --> 00:29:03.536
So?

00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:06.888
Why does it take you so long?

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.088
Other students outside the camp
probably got it by now.

00:29:14.104 --> 00:29:16.616
NO.6 ANANTACHAI KRAIKAEW

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:19.800
What?

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:21.888
Why didn’t you tell me?

00:29:21.928 --> 00:29:22.616
Let me have a bite.

00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:23.496
Mhee.

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:24.552
Mhee.

00:29:24.584 --> 00:29:25.656
Mhee.

00:29:55.712 --> 00:29:56.808
Class dismissed.

00:29:56.832 --> 00:29:58.200
Thank you.

00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:00.000
Guys.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:00.312
Guys.

00:30:00.344 --> 00:30:02.648
The probability questions in today’s class
are very difficult.

00:30:02.904 --> 00:30:04.152
Shall we study more together?

00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:06.392
Hey.

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:08.488
Do you want to study with us?

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:10.040
Sure.

00:30:19.312 --> 00:30:21.310
This question was in this camp’s exam
five years ago.

00:30:21.328 --> 00:30:22.536
Is there anyone who wants to solve it?

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:46.144
Mawin.

00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:48.848
Can you go help Mhee?

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:52.536
Let him do it.

00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:08.344
Everyone.

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:12.800
Let’s change the way we study.

00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:25.240
Sister, are you saying I’m the culprit?

00:31:27.570 --> 00:31:30.864
Didn’t you hit my boyfriend in the last round?

00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:35.704
I survived because of your love, Lady Petch.

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:36.984
Honey.

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:41.472
Which one of you did it?

00:31:41.496 --> 00:31:43.216
Who is the culprit?

00:31:43.256 --> 00:31:45.696
I told you Petch is the culprit.

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:47.456
Miss Mangpor.

00:31:57.780 --> 00:31:59.328
I told you.

00:31:59.368 --> 00:32:00.000
You cannot trust Lady Petch.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:00.984
You cannot trust Lady Petch.

00:32:01.008 --> 00:32:02.400
Is it because I’m just a maid?

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:04.320
So none of you believe me.

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:07.152
Gardener.

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.150
Tell them that I’m telling the truth.

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:21.176
There’s a high chance
that Lady Petch is the culprit.

00:32:21.208 --> 00:32:25.304
But I think we should suspect the doctor.

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:26.920
How insolent!

00:32:26.952 --> 00:32:28.424
You’re just a gardener.

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:29.480
How dare you judge me?

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:31.936
I brought this doctor from Bangkok.

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:33.704
Actually, I’m a doctor.

00:32:33.752 --> 00:32:35.904
I saved Prik-klua’s life last night.

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:38.896
The fake doctor and Grandma,

00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:40.976
you two are the culprits.

00:32:41.008 --> 00:32:42.810
Hold on.

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:45.600
Hold on. You guys are being fooled by him.

00:32:45.632 --> 00:32:48.192
I’m the real doctor. He’s not.

00:32:48.232 --> 00:32:50.296
I saved his life in the last round.

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:52.112
Wait.

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:54.504
Didn’t you say that Mawin was the culprit?

00:32:54.544 --> 00:32:55.936
Then why did you save his life?

00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:58.296
I had to make my choice at the moment.

00:32:58.740 --> 00:32:59.808
But I also suspected him.

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:00.000
Everyone,

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.328
Everyone,

00:33:01.368 --> 00:33:03.440
I think we should vote Mhee out in this round.

00:33:03.464 --> 00:33:05.128
We can vote Golf out in the next round.

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:06.608
It’s time to vote.

00:33:06.656 --> 00:33:08.656
I’ll count to three, then you cast your vote.

00:33:08.688 --> 00:33:11.120
One, two, three, vote.

00:33:16.968 --> 00:33:19.550
Are you sure
you’re the top talents of the nation?

00:33:20.112 --> 00:33:21.550
I can’t believe it.

00:33:22.712 --> 00:33:23.760
It must be him.

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:29.664
I think it’s Mawin.

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:30.704
I don’t know.

00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:33.800
Hold on. Weren’t you on my side?

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:35.760
Is Mawin the culprit?

00:33:35.784 --> 00:33:37.112
Right?

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:03.016
Why do you put a wet towel on the bedhead?

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:04.528
That?

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:08.792
My throat often feels dry.

00:34:08.848 --> 00:34:11.664
My mom put a wet towel on my bedhead.

00:34:11.688 --> 00:34:12.936
It helps.

00:34:13.976 --> 00:34:14.752
Really?

00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:16.064
You should try it too.

00:34:16.104 --> 00:34:18.816
I saw you often coughing at night.

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:21.784
Hey.

00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:24.720
It was so funny to gang up on Mhee
during the game today.

00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:27.032
At first, I was going to kill him.

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:29.232
But Mangpor said we should spare him.

00:34:29.256 --> 00:34:30.568
Because no one paid attention to him anyway.

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:35.696
Did you have fun?

00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:37.576
Yes.

00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:38.712
What about you?

00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:41.520
I love board games.

00:34:41.864 --> 00:34:43.240
When I was young,

00:34:43.288 --> 00:34:44.800
I often went to a board game café.

00:34:44.832 --> 00:34:46.032
I had my go-to place.

00:34:46.048 --> 00:34:47.760
Many board game pros went to this place.

00:34:47.792 --> 00:34:50.272
I love playing with them.

00:34:50.288 --> 00:34:53.056
Next time, you, Benz, Mhee, and I
should go there together.

00:34:53.072 --> 00:34:53.984
Do you want to go?

00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:04.440
I like board games too.

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:07.672
But don’t have any friends to play with.

00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:11.032
Thank you so much.

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:12.832
I had a great time today.

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:16.816
Right.

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:21.264
I haven’t told you the answer in exchange
for you eating the instant noodles.

00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:27.368
The secret thing that you were listening to?

00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:28.688
Yes.

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:32.640
I’ll let you guess what I was listening to.

00:35:33.490 --> 00:35:35.912
I think it’s a lesson summary,

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:41.728
Maybe a foreign tutor teaches equilibrium theory?

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:46.176
Were you listening to Mozart?

00:35:47.330 --> 00:35:49.064
What is it? I ran out of ideas.

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:51.944
(But he’s really quick on my IG stories.)

00:35:51.968 --> 00:35:53.360
(Aren’t you reading too much into it?)

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:56.024
(I’m also quick on IG stories of Korean stars.)

00:35:56.064 --> 00:35:57.880
(You need to understand…)

00:35:57.912 --> 00:36:00.000
Is this Once More with Stories by Tle?

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:00.408
Is this Once More with Stories by Tle?

00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:02.840
You are listening to the radio?

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:07.192
While we were listening to the teacher,

00:36:07.216 --> 00:36:08.776
you were listening to the radio?

00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:12.168
It’s very fun.

00:36:12.192 --> 00:36:14.104
Shows are rotating all day.

00:36:14.144 --> 00:36:15.664
People say whatever they want.

00:36:17.496 --> 00:36:19.112
I can’t believe it.

00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:21.952
There are many fun shows.

00:36:21.976 --> 00:36:24.664
In the afternoon, there are shows

00:36:24.704 --> 00:36:26.544
about agriculture and housework

00:36:26.584 --> 00:36:28.448
At night, there’s a ghost story show.

00:36:28.496 --> 00:36:31.032
I listen to it and fall asleep.

00:36:31.056 --> 00:36:33.030
There’s a news show in the morning.

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:34.904
They are very fun.

00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:41.320
This is the first time I heard
you say something this long.

00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:46.768
(He’s quick on your IG stories and asks you
to work with him on a school assignment…)

00:36:46.792 --> 00:36:48.208
You seem to really like it.

00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:51.424
(But that’s not all.)

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:53.600
(When he looks at me.)

00:36:53.648 --> 00:36:55.304
(When we look at each other.)

00:36:55.312 --> 00:36:57.300
(Though it’s only a few seconds long,)

00:36:57.328 --> 00:36:59.300
(I can really feel it, Tle.)

00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:02.496
(I don’t know what he thinks of me.)

00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:03.984
(But I think there’s something between us.)

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:06.496
(My heart is racing.)

00:37:06.536 --> 00:37:08.768
(I don’t know how to act.)

00:37:09.048 --> 00:37:10.232
(My head goes blank.)

00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:13.640
(Do you think I have feelings for him?)

00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:15.792
(I feel shy talking about it.)

00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:19.344
(Tle, do you think I have feelings for him?)

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:27.520
(Gosh, I’m blushing listening to you.)

00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:42.352
(Today’s weather is unstable.)

00:37:42.384 --> 00:37:44.984
(Heavy rain is expected in the morning.)

00:37:45.008 --> 00:37:46.920
(Blazing hot weather is expected
in the afternoon.)

00:37:46.952 --> 00:37:48.920
(Breezy weather is expected in the evening.)

00:37:48.968 --> 00:37:52.632
(The weather is unstable and unpredictable.)

00:37:57.504 --> 00:37:58.272
Hey.

00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:00.000
Are you going to eat it while standing,
like when you drink cocktails?

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.016
Are you going to eat it while standing,
like when you drink cocktails?

00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:04.544
Go take a seat.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.232
Can you sit with him?

00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:09.976
I have to talk to Pornthep.

00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:14.288
What’s wrong with him?

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:22.392
Win, can I sit with you?

00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:24.680
What’s wrong with Err?

00:38:25.632 --> 00:38:27.630
Why are you listening to music all the time?

00:38:38.168 --> 00:38:39.536
Well done, Mangpor.

00:38:39.576 --> 00:38:40.928
Your question is excellent.

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:42.392
But it’s really hard, right?

00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:47.968
You told me to create a difficult question.

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:50.640
Sugus’s question is also hard.

00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:53.096
Difficult questions are good.

00:38:53.128 --> 00:38:54.960
Everyone, check your answer.

00:38:55.008 --> 00:38:56.656
If your answer is close to this, you did well.

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:00.000
You came up with questions
for your classmates to solve.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.168
You came up with questions
for your classmates to solve.

00:39:01.216 --> 00:39:02.560
Did you have fun?

00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:03.768
It’s fun, right?

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:05.184
I had fun too.

00:39:05.216 --> 00:39:06.504
Who will be next?

00:39:06.536 --> 00:39:08.500
Top student, Mawin, come out.

00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:10.256
Come here.

00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:23.952
The mission given by your fortune teller,

00:39:23.968 --> 00:39:25.144
how does it go?

00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:29.152
It’s not going anywhere.

00:39:29.352 --> 00:39:31.150
I get it.

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:33.688
Your friend is scary smart.

00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:35.768
I won’t play games with him anymore.

00:39:35.816 --> 00:39:37.448
How can he be good at everything?

00:39:39.450 --> 00:39:42.168
Are you sure they can solve your question?

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:43.648
Everyone, give it a try.

00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:20.936
Yes?

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:22.864
The answer is 138.

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:24.088
138?

00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:26.352
Mawin, reveal the answer.

00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:29.184
The answer is 138.

00:40:29.752 --> 00:40:30.912
Correct.

00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:35.512
Well done.

00:40:35.536 --> 00:40:36.624
Mawin, go back to your seat.

00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:39.984
Who will be next?

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:42.560
Win.

00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:45.016
If you’re going to create such a difficult question,

00:40:45.064 --> 00:40:46.752
no one can solve it.

00:40:47.250 --> 00:40:50.240
Mawin, if you’re going to study abroad,
will you come back and work as a teacher?

00:40:50.288 --> 00:40:51.424
I’m rooting for you.

00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:55.232
It’s good to be a genius.

00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:56.952
Do you have other difficult questions?

00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:58.728
Can you share them with me?

00:40:58.752 --> 00:41:00.000
When I can solve it,
they will compliment me too.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:00.730
When I can solve it,
they will compliment me too.

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:02.496
Are you serious?

00:41:02.830 --> 00:41:03.544
Yes.

00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:05.240
You promise.

00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:07.136
You promise, Mhee?

00:41:07.176 --> 00:41:07.920
Yes.

00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:09.912
You promise.

00:41:10.350 --> 00:41:11.592
You need to keep your word.

00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:14.280
I don’t care if you two are from Boromavidya.

00:41:14.310 --> 00:41:18.480
I also got A’s
in both core and selective mathematics.

00:41:18.512 --> 00:41:21.728
It’s so easy, chill, and simple.

00:41:35.310 --> 00:41:37.872
Damn, it’s freaking hard.

00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:42.336
I knew it.

00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:50.176
Your question is hard.

00:41:50.216 --> 00:41:51.672
No one can solve it.

00:41:52.832 --> 00:41:54.830
But you are the first who solve it.

00:41:54.856 --> 00:41:55.984
Why didn’t you raise your hand to answer?

00:41:58.560 --> 00:41:59.296
I don’t know.

00:41:59.344 --> 00:42:00.000
I was afraid I might be wrong.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:00.592
I was afraid I might be wrong.

00:42:03.088 --> 00:42:04.248
If you’re wrong, so what?

00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:08.264
I don’t know.

00:42:08.296 --> 00:42:10.728
When we played the game at the pool,

00:42:11.090 --> 00:42:12.392
I was afraid to say the answer first.

00:42:12.416 --> 00:42:14.064
I waited until a team member said it first.

00:42:14.112 --> 00:42:17.424
I didn’t feel confident in my answer.

00:42:20.250 --> 00:42:21.920
You believe in everyone,

00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:26.320
but yourself.

00:42:30.070 --> 00:42:31.552
Try to have faith in yourself.

00:42:33.550 --> 00:42:35.160
If you get it wrong, just do it again.

00:42:37.610 --> 00:42:38.720
It’s not a big deal.

00:42:43.070 --> 00:42:44.400
Go and solve it.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.544
There’s only me in this room.

00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:57.168
You don’t need to worry about getting it wrong.

00:44:38.048 --> 00:44:41.776
(For racing horses, waking up early or late,)

00:44:41.832 --> 00:44:44.112
(or stop to have some fun along the way,)

00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:46.912
(it’s not a big deal.)

00:44:54.050 --> 00:44:57.464
(Even when they get the answer wrong,)

00:44:58.744 --> 00:44:59.848
(it’s okay.)

00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:25.048
(When we are running together,)

00:45:25.096 --> 00:45:27.240
(it can be more joyful
than reaching the finish line.)

00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:31.776
[Seer, I have nothing to update today.]

00:45:31.824 --> 00:45:34.592
[I suddenly have this confidence.]

00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:36.648
[I can do it.]

00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:58.600
Are you following the fortune teller’s advice?

00:45:58.632 --> 00:46:00.000
If you really want this scholarship,
you need to make him fall for you.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.416
If you really want this scholarship,
you need to make him fall for you.

00:46:02.448 --> 00:46:03.224
We only spend a few days together.

00:46:03.248 --> 00:46:04.336
There’s no way he will fall for me.

00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:06.720
If I fall for you, you will win this scholarship, right?

00:46:06.752 --> 00:46:08.672
It happens all the time in drama series.

00:46:08.712 --> 00:46:11.536
You should take off the earphones and talk to people.

00:46:11.576 --> 00:46:12.664
Who can I talk to?

00:46:12.688 --> 00:46:13.904
You have me.

00:46:13.936 --> 00:46:16.040
Attending this camp is quite fun.

00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:17.072
How about you?

00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:19.248
Do you have fun spending time with me?

00:46:19.272 --> 00:46:20.096
Yes.

00:46:20.590 --> 00:46:21.872
I like being with you.
