WEBVTT

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.240
Junji-san,

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.440
will you be my boyfriend?

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.560
It’s impossible

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.520
between me

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.760
and Junji-san.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.760
Why do you feel guilty about Yuka?

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.560
I mean, Yuka and Junji

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.600
are the same person.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.080
Why does he

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.560
have to lie to everyone?

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.560
Let’s go back to how we were.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.160
Now I know how I truly feel.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.280
Give me one more chance, Junji.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.080
Don't!

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.200
Please, let me prove it to you.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.280
Just this once, Junji.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.560
Letting me back was the right call.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.280
I'm confident

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.280
I can make this game better than the last.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.920
Because I’m the only one

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.560
who knows you best, Junji.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.360
Even about…

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.560
I won't give up.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.640
Not on the game,

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.200
and not on Junji-san.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.040
Alright.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.240
We'll see.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.720
Good news today, everyone.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.080
Our new game

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.160
has a sponsor now.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.120
Wow.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.320
The game’s not even done,

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.920
and you managed to sell it?

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:57.840
Good job, newbie!

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.560
Yeah.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.160
Of course.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.000
Gen Z is built for speed.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.560
Gen Z is built for speed.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.960
So this means

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.160
we Gen Y folks

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.120
have more work now?

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.040
Well…

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.840
That's a yes.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.520
But I think it’s worth the effort.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.040
Take a look.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.760
White Memories Hotel,

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.120
our major sponsor,

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.840
wants there to be a hotel scene

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:14.560
in the game.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.240
Hang on.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.120
Boss,

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.040
don't tell me…

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.960
Stats for Otome game (male dating sim)

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:22.880
show that

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.920
the most popular date
location among players

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.240
is the beach.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.080
I agree with you.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.520
You're the best, Boss.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.040
Hey. We're in a meeting.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.400
But…

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.720
Think of something and pitch it to me.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.040
I want everyone

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.560
to scout for

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.320
the spot

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.320
for the game’s ending scene.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.880
Okay.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.160
But that’s the hardest part.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.520
We'll have to please both players

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.040
and the sponsor.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.680
If we focus too much on tie-ins,

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.000
it’ll ruin the game’s vibe.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.040
it’ll ruin the game’s vibe.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.840
In other words,

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.000
it won’t feel real.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.880
That's true.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.960
This one’s tough,

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.200
it needs someone with a lot of experience.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.800
According to my research,

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.840
or rather, based on what Junji said,

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.400
having dinner

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.320
by the beach

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.200
and looking fashionable

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.040
will help players decide more easily.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.040
I’ve been studying

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.840
ever since I got this project.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.320
Having been with this game since day one,

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.200
I know the players best,

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.040
I mean, among everyone here.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.640
Mm.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.560
I think I should handle it myself.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.280
And as for you…

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.440
Focus on the bugs you were assigned to fix.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:14.640
Our team

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.760
should all work together.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.080
If anyone comes up with an idea,

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.200
bring it up

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:21.520
on that day.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.960
Okay.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.440
Isn't this a full-on battle?

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.280
So intense.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:34.320
Right.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.000
This trip’s gonna be fun for sure.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.360
Can’t wait to see who wins.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:39.960
I'm Team Hill.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.280
Why are you being so nosy?

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.440
Then,

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.520
why are you gossiping?

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.720
Just feeling you out.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.560
Bay.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.760
Yes?

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.120
Get Phat to come along.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.440
Tell him

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.120
it's for gathering materials.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:57.240
Alright.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.000
Don't know about them

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.040
but I've already won.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.480
What nonsense are you saying?

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:06.080
What?

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.720
I was talking

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.240
about them.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.960
Who are you—?

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.520
Well, I have my own battle.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.040
Let me carry that.

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.240
Hey, it’s fine.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.560
Come on, let me.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.680
Let me.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:51.000
Tomorrow,

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:52.640
you'll come to the office

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.280
and we’ll leave together.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.520
Well…

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:57.840
Please?

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.160
I want to enjoy it with you.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:00.000
Think of it as gathering materials.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.440
Think of it as gathering materials.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:02.880
Okay?

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.440
Let me think about it.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.160
Is this a celebration?

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.200
You’re going all out.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:50.640
Oh.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.480
Nothing, it’s nothing.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:52.920
But

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.920
you’re up late too.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.080
Actually, I was already asleep.

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:58.800
So,

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:00.000
what’s behind you?

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:00.320
what’s behind you?

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:01.240
Ah.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:02.480
- Nothing.
- Can I see?

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:03.640
- Can I see?

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:03.920
But

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:05.680
there's nothing.

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:07.320
Heh.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.920
Oh wow.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.520
That’s a huge roasted duck.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.120
It's Phat’s favorite.

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.000
I think,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.520
the smell must woke me up.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:22.720
I see.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.280
Well,

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:25.240
want to join us for a meal?

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.040
I was joking.

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.040
I just came down for some water.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.360
Alright.

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:31.960
Make yourself at home.

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.280
Once you're done eating, it’ll be late.

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.960
Why don’t you let him stay over tonight?

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.720
Isn't tomorrow a day off?

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:47.560
No need.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:48.680
He can go home just fine.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.080
I see.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.600
In that case,

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.320
I’ll take this then.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:56.440
Okay.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:57.960
Off to bed.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:58.960
Good night.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:00.000
Good night, sis.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:00.680
Good night, sis.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:28.400
What is it?

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:34.720
It’s…

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:41.240
This.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:43.400
I…

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.400
I’ve been reflecting all this time

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.640
that I want to give this love a try.

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:51.680
I’ve never felt like
this for anyone before.

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.080
Is it because I’m your first guy?

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.360
It’s not about

00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.560
your gender at all.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.000
You're the right person.

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.800
And that feeling

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.720
just keeps growing.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.120
And now I

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:14.000
I know that

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:17.480
everything, including that night…

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.480
- I—
- About that night,

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:19.600
I have no issue with it.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:20.760
But I think

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.080
you shouldn’t rush into acting this way.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:25.640
Phat.

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:27.000
I just want us—

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.600
If you want to keep it casual,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000
I'd understand.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:31.280
Maybe

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:32.080
our work

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:32.960
was what caused us

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.000
to get carried away in that moment.

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:37.640
It’s not like that, Phat.

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:38.040
I—

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.560
I think…

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.640
Don’t say anything just yet.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:45.160
Sorry.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.160
It’s just…

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:50.200
I don’t even know

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.000
how I feel myself.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.120
Please don’t pressure me on this.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:06.800
Okay.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.080
I understand.

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.320
I should head back now.

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.200
It's getting late.

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.240
I forgot we’re leaving early tomorrow.

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:26.000
Still,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.480
I really want you

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.720
to come along, Phat.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:03.880
Hey,

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:05.400
Pao and the Gang,

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.760
aren’t your outfits too casual?

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:08.400
We’re going to work,

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.080
not on vacation.

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:10.960
What the heck?

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.200
Lady.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.760
If you insult me, I can take it,

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:16.080
but you insult my team,
I can’t let that slide.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:17.600
What's wrong with this outfit?

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.120
We’re going to the beach,

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.360
you want us in suits, ties,

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:21.960
slacks, and pointy shoes?

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.000
You should follow my example.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:24.880
A model employee.

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.480
You’re too uptight.

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:27.560
We're not at the office.

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:28.360
That's true.

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:28.920
Right?

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:29.760
You look so

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:30.560
out of place.

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.160
Everyone's ready?

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:36.920
Ready!

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:37.960
My team?

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.040
That'll be me.

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:41.560
Someone

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.520
has to keep you

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.280
from wandering off god knows where.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:45.560
What the heck.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:46.840
We’re busted.

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:47.600
She got us good.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.600
Boom, you’re coming too.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.280
And Hill,

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:51.480
You are riding with me.

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:52.840
Me too?

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:53.480
Of course.

00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:58.600
So,

00:13:58.800 --> 00:13:59.560
What about…

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:00.960
Art? Is he not here?

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:03.440
He'd already left at 3 a.m.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.760
Said he was checking on the tide,

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:06.920
meteor showers,

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:08.320
and sunrise times.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.360
He’s serious about this.

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.240
Will you be okay?

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:12.560
Really?

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:13.000
Yeah.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:13.600
Well, damn.

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:16.000
Art’s really hardworking.

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:16.480
Man.

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:22.880
Can I still join you guys?

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.840
About time you showed up.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:30.040
Thought you weren’t coming.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.360
Then

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:33.120
ride with me, Phat.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.720
[teasing noises]

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:40.680
Oh,

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:41.720
Sorry.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:42.360
We have

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.440
made plans

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.480
to ride together.

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:45.360
Boss!

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:46.680
What?

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:48.760
Alright,

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:49.280
everyone.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.600
Let’s all meet at the hotel

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:52.960
before sunset, got it?

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.280
Let's go.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:54.760
Move it.

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:56.640
Why don’t you ride with Boss?

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:57.600
Drive carefully, okay?

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.720
No speeding, no ticket.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:14:59.520
Boom,

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:00.000
load it in the car.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:00.320
load it in the car.

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.200
- Hill, ride with us.
- Wait, Hill.

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.480
Hill, you're with me.

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:04.760
- I'm driving alone.
- Huh?

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:05.640
I'm all alone.

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:06.400
I need company.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:07.800
- Take care of him.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:08.880
- Okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:09.800
We meet at six!

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:13.160
Why aren’t you helping me lift my bag?

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.480
Just give your bag to Boom!

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.080
You talk too much.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.680
Thinking about Bay?

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.160
You really know me well.

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.920
Well, you are my best friend.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:44.200
You can tell me anything, you know.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:45.920
Why?

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.520
Don’t you have enough on your mind already?

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:50.720
Especially about Hill.

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:54.840
So you know.

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:59.000
- You are my best friend.
- You are my best friend.

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.040
I’m just confused.

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:10.240
I can’t even explain it right now.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:13.000
What about you?

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:16.400
Well,

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:17.960
a little bit.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:20.600
Honestly, it’s nothing.

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:22.880
Right now,

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.520
I just want to focus on the game.

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:26.920
It’s about to launch.

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:31.200
Just you wait.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:34.120
One day, I’m going to
find out what’s in your heart.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.960
I won’t make it easy for you!

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:04.320
Alright.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.960
The guys have to pair up.

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:09.280
One room, two people.

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:10.960
Oh man,

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.040
please don't pair me up with Pao.

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:13.960
I need to sleep.

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:14.920
Oh, please.

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:17.120
Like I’m dying to room with you, Boom.

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.040
I’ve already picked.

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:19.800
Bay.

00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:22.520
You’re with me.

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:24.000
We’ll drink until sunrise.

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.240
Love you, man.

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:29.440
But can I not room with you?

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:34.160
You sure are loved, Pao.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.080
[laughing]

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:37.120
That’s a big blow.

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:43.600
I’ve got an idea.

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:46.880
How about a game?

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:48.840
Whoever wins

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.240
gets to choose their roommate.

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:54.600
Sure.

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:55.080
Okay.

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:00.880
Sounds good.

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:06.080
I think that’s a good idea.

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.520
When it comes to games,

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:09.800
I rarely lose.

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:11.040
Oh…

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.360
That's good but

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:19.200
aren't you too confident?

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.440
No one can win every time.

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:23.160
Well,

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:26.040
if you lose, you’d better accept it.

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:44.080
So what game should we play?

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.520
The newspaper stepping game.

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:55.880
The rules are simple.

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:59.440
Pair up and stand together on
a single sheet of newspaper.

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:00.000
Whoever can balance the longest

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.320
Whoever can balance the longest

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:04.240
gets to pick the room and roommate.

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.120
Good?

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:05.720
Let's go.

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.880
Okay, both teams get ready.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:09.760
Yeah!

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:11.600
Go easy on me, Bay.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:12.760
Start!

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:14.080
[blows whistle]

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:22.680
Hey, Pao.

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:23.680
Let me have this.

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:25.160
Who are you going to room with?

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:26.920
If you let me win,

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:30.040
I’ll treat you to a buffet at 5-star hotel.

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.640
A buffet at 5-star hotel?

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:32.280
Yeah.

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:34.520
I'm not a idiot.

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:36.320
I want to room with Boom.

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:37.880
I need someone I'm close to.

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:38.400
Sorry, man.

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:39.960
A buffet won’t save you.

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:40.560
Go!

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:41.760
Ow.

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:42.480
[laughing]

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.120
Pao!

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:44.480
Pao wins!

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:46.400
Victory!

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.120
I pick Boom.

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:48.560
[laughing]

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:50.480
Bay, you’re weak.

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:51.320
Damn it.

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:52.160
Phat,

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:55.400
you’re with me.

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:56.720
Alright,

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:59.320
that’s everyone paired up.

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:00.000
Okay.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:00.120
Okay.

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:02.240
Bay.

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:02.440
Hm?

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:03.280
I’m screwed.

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:04.760
I have to room with Pao.

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:06.080
I won’t sleep a wink tonight.

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:08.680
Good luck, bro.

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:10.520
I didn’t have to pay for a buffet.

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:11.600
Pao’s an idiot.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Yeah, true.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Hey, what’s that?

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:16.480
Pao’s a genius.

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:17.440
Oh.

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:18.000
Super smart.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.400
Of course I am, Boom.

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:19.960
Jeez, dude.

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:22.040
Let's keep going.

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:23.760
Next round!

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.080
Fold the newspaper, Boom.

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:27.040
That was too easy.

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.040
Here we go.

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:34.360
Hill and Art, ready?

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:35.520
Take your positions.

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:49.000
Start!

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000
[blows whistle]

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:55.840
No matter what, I’m not losing this game.

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.400
Tonight, I'm rooming with Junji.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:58.520
We’ll see about that.

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:00.000
Let’s find out who’s more persistent.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.240
Let’s find out who’s more persistent.

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:01.920
Heh.

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:07.320
Hey,

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:08.480
who's going to win?

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:10.720
I can’t even tell.

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:11.400
Dude.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.040
Doesn't look like they’re competing…

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:13.800
but helping—

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:14.600
Helping each other.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:15.840
It's too damn hot.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:17.240
When will they be done?

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:18.800
Right.

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:37.240
You still haven’t given up?

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:38.240
No way.

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:40.080
I can do this all day.

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:41.720
And you?

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:42.760
Can you?

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:43.800
Ha.

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:45.120
Of course I can.

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:48.280
But I can’t!

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:49.880
[blows whistle]

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:50.880
What?

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:51.680
Hey!

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:52.800
It’s scorching out here.

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:54.240
Let’s stop.

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:55.640
Break it up.

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:56.360
Hold on.

00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:57.880
We still don’t have a winner.

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:04.720
Let’s call it…

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:05.600
a tie.

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:06.680
Huh?

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:11.560
But—

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:12.640
But why, Junji?

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:13.320
Yeah.

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:15.840
You two have been at it for ages,

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:18.320
and you’ve lasted this long.

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.800
That's amazing.

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:22.200
How about

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:24.280
you two share a room?

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:25.800
Boss gets his own room.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.520
Alright? Break it up.

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:28.600
My skin’s burning here.

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:29.120
No way!

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:30.600
I have to room with Art?

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:34.720
You and him

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.160
can talk about work.

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:36.960
You have

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:38.360
qualities that

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:39.200
help each other.

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:45.520
Boss.

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:48.520
Let’s go.

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:49.200
Come on.

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:51.480
So,

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:53.280
Boss wins

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:54.000
this game.

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:56.960
Isn't he awesome?

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:58.200
Let’s go!

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:24.400
You take the bed.

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.760
I’ll sleep on the floor.

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:27.080
No way,

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:28.520
just take the bed.

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:31.040
Sorry,

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:32.280
I just don’t want us

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:33.560
to cross any lines

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:36.040
like that night.

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:38.240
I

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:39.440
didn’t mean anything

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:40.600
like that.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.600
I just meant you take the bed,

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:43.920
I’ll sleep on the floor.

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:45.040
But—

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:46.160
No buts.

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.120
If you don’t sleep on the bed,

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:51.160
I won’t sleep either.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:51.960
Okay?

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:53.200
You're stubborn.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:53.960
Yep.

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:55.840
They call me King of Stubbornness.

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:03.560
Today I saw you smile,

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:04.720
I’m satisfied.

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.040
Nonsense.

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:08.840
Go take a shower

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:10.120
before you sleep.

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:13.800
[screams]

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:14.360
Hey!

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:14.920
Bay!

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:15.880
What?

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:16.960
Grab it!

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:20.200
A baby lizard?

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:21.520
Doesn't matter the size,

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:22.760
They are all scary to me.

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:23.440
Hurry,

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:24.360
Catch it!

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:25.280
Wait, wait.

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:26.200
If you

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.320
sleep on the bed,

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:29.160
I get the floor,

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:29.880
then I'll do it.

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.320
Fine. I’ll sleep on the bed!

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:32.080
What was that?

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:33.800
I’ll sleep on the bed!

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:35.840
Hurry up and catch it!

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:36.720
Very well.

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:40.720
Take it outside.

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:41.600
Done.

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:43.120
Bay!

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:44.360
Come on.

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:44.960
Not funny.

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:54.200
It’s gone now.

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:55.800
See?

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:01.320
47

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:03.000
48

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:06.160
49

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:10.160
50

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:10.920
[sighs]

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:13.840
[exhales slowly]

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:21.840
You should exercise more.

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:23.840
It’ll make you healthier.

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.520
But honestly, I think getting enough sleep

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:30.320
isn’t such a bad idea either.

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:34.240
But right now,

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:34.960
I can’t sleep.

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:38.280
Tomorrow, you’ll be able to.

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:40.600
Because you’ll be by yourself.

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:42.880
Why’s that?

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:44.360
You’re giving up and…

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:45.360
go back home?

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:49.960
The one who's going home

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:51.360
would be you.

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.480
If I leave,

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.240
I’ll leave with Boss.

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:00.000
Let me be clear with you.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:00.440
Let me be clear with you.

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:02.560
I like Junji.

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:06.200
And tomorrow, I’m going to win him back.

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:09.520
A newbie like you

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:12.600
doesn't know the history between us.

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:15.400
Our relationship

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.400
back when we worked on
"Yuka! Love Me Please."

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:20.600
Hmph.

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:22.200
Oh, please.

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:26.080
That game you abandoned?

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:29.440
Don’t act like some old man reminiscing.

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:32.200
You don’t need to tell me.

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:33.240
Don’t want to hear it.

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:34.160
It’s a waste of time.

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:36.880
All I know is

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:38.560
if it had been good,

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.440
you wouldn’t have to apologize to him.

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:45.640
Live in the present, okay?

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:48.520
I’m glad

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:49.600
you came back.

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:53.040
So let’s help each other

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:54.600
make this game a success.

00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:57.640
And don’t do anything,

00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:59.920
or act in any way,

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:00.000
that’ll hurt him again.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.760
that’ll hurt him again.

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:10.520
Okay.

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:13.520
Tomorrow, just wait and see.

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:15.720
But know this,

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:17.280
when it comes to him,

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:19.760
I'll never give up.

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:49.280
Hey, Bay.

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:49.880
So,

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:51.240
are we allowed to film here?

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.800
Ugh, my head hurts…

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:56.000
What a headache.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:56.680
Dude.

00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:57.600
What’s wrong?

00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:58.600
Did you hit your head?

00:27:59.400 --> 00:27:59.920
This is

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:00.000
work, not a vacation.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.520
work, not a vacation.

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:03.440
I know. I'm using my head right now!

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:06.040
For work?

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:06.520
Yeah.

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:07.520
About Phat?

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:09.880
Ugh…

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:10.680
You got me.

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:11.480
There's only him.

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:13.080
What did you do this time?

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:16.000
I don’t even know…

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:16.560
I…

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:18.560
I must’ve done something.

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:18.960
But

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:20.800
yesterday things were fine.

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:22.240
Nothing happened but…

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:25.960
Hey,

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:27.680
be honest, okay?

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:30.680
Do you like Phat?

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:34.520
Of course I do.

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:36.520
Never felt this way about anyone before.

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:37.800
Good.

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:39.200
If you like him,

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:41.320
you’ve got to prove

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:42.760
that you're here to stay.

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:44.840
That's what I’ve been doing!

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:46.080
Isn't it obvious?

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:48.120
It is.

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:49.320
But

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:50.720
I don’t think it’s enough.

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:51.880
Given your

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:53.120
colorful history.

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:54.000
Hey,

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:54.480
Hill.

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:55.600
Are you insulting me?

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:58.040
Just speaking the truth.

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:14.320
Bay.

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:14.600
What?

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:16.120
Help me out.

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:18.600
When I

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:20.760
bring Boss here to present this spot,

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:22.240
I want you to

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:23.440
set off some fireworks.

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:24.440
Create a vibe, yeah?

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:25.520
Wow.

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:26.840
Why you…

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:29.640
So first you insult me,

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:31.840
and now you want my help?

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:33.080
Yeah?

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:35.080
Come on, please.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:37.760
[sighs]

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:38.800
Oh, come on.

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:40.120
Bay.

00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:51.400
So,

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:53.840
what’s going on with Bay?

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:56.320
Where's the bright and cheerful Phat?

00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:59.240
Is it really that obvious?

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:01.360
Well,

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:02.840
you’ve been so quiet.

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:12.040
It's suffocating.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.280
Is it about your mom?

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:22.640
Phat,

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:24.880
you seem to like Bay

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:26.640
quite a lot.

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:29.200
Mom's just a part of it.

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:31.280
Another part of me is scared

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:33.240
he’ll leave me.

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:36.400
Not sure if I’m enough

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:38.320
to really make him like me.

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:45.160
If you already like him,

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:48.320
then there’s nothing to be afraid of.

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:51.800
What about you?

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:55.520
How long are you going
to keep them in a race?

00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:58.640
It'll be awkward for them as co-workers.

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:02.560
Why?

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:05.000
Can’t they just be

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.160
normal co-workers?

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:08.960
Have you forgotten?

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:10.560
Both of them like you.

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:12.760
Maybe

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:14.320
you should stop the race

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:16.080
and face them at the finish line.

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:19.400
Trust what’s inside your heart, my friend.

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:23.960
There they are.

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:26.040
Boss, can we join in?

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:28.440
Come on.

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:30.000
You two must be lonely.

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:33.320
Boss…

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:34.880
I think…

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:36.280
Since we are

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:37.800
doing activities here anyway,

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:39.360
we should do something

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:40.880
to build team spirit.

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:41.600
What do you say?

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:43.280
Sure.

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:44.560
Wow, this is the first time

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:47.360
Pao has come up with something nice.

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:48.920
I do it all the time!

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:51.680
What do you think, Boss?

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:53.520
sounds good.

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:54.640
Since we are here

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:56.120
surveying the place,

00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:57.160
let’s take this chance

00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:58.960
to do a group activity.

00:31:58.960 --> 00:31:59.600
Yeah!

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:01.240
But I’ll warn you,

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:02.760
if you're going against me,

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:03.800
be prepared to lose.

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:04.960
But if

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:06.920
it’s just about winning, that's no fun.

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:13.760
How about we…

00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:15.640
…give losers

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:16.920
the barbecue duty.

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:17.480
Deal?

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:19.120
Damn.

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:20.560
That's smart

00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:22.000
and cheeky.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:22.440
I like it.

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:22.960
I’m in.

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:24.000
I'm sold.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.400
Of course!

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:26.480
My team has never lost
at any office sports event.

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:28.920
Really?

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:29.880
Never lost?

00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:30.240
Never.

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:31.280
Yeah, right.

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:31.880
It’s true!

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:33.080
Team up with me.

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:33.360
What?

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:33.960
I want to win.

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:34.880
Okay?

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:35.720
Fine,

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:36.360
it's a deal.

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:38.720
For selfishness,

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:40.440
you've got to give it to Pao.

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:41.600
What?

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:42.720
I just want to win.

00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:44.880
What’s going on? Let me join too!

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:52.560
Oh.

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:53.960
- This is gonna be fun.
- Very fun.

00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:58.840
Alright then.

00:32:58.840 --> 00:32:59.520
Me,

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:00.000
Boom,

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:00.400
Boom,

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:01.000
and Ching

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.680
will be the referees.

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:03.840
Great.

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:05.560
Okay.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.920
So, three people per team.

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:09.160
It's beach volleyball.

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:10.640
If you lose,

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:13.120
you’re on barbecue duty tonight.

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:14.240
Okay?

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:15.120
Okay!

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:19.480
Referees, take your positions

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:20.320
you’re in the way.

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:21.440
Go, go!

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:23.480
Want to lose?

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:24.640
Hey, don't!

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:28.800
Everyone stay behind me.

00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:30.200
I’ll handle it.

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:32.200
Wow.

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:33.440
Our hero’s stepping up.

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:34.200
But I’ll say this,

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:35.560
us villains are totally

00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:36.600
going to win.

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:40.280
Hey, Junji.

00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:40.640
What?

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:41.840
Are you okay?

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:42.520
You tired?

00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:43.560
You can rest,

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:44.560
I’ll take care of it.

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:45.760
You’ll get sunburned.

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:49.280
Ouch, sunburn.

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:49.760
Can I

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:51.280
Can I switch to the hero’s team?

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:51.680
Hey.

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:52.680
Hey, Hill!

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:54.720
You can’t switch to their team.

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.160
You better not throw the game.

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:56.880
Stay here.

00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:57.440
Jeez.

00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:59.240
Are we gonna keep talking?

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:00.000
I want to finish this fast.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.360
I want to finish this fast.

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:02.560
Whoa

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:03.800
Boss.

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:04.760
If you say that,

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:06.160
then don’t be mad

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:07.200
if I go all out.

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:09.880
Right now, we're no friends.

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:11.320
So smash with all you've got.

00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:12.320
Whoa.

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:13.800
Now you’ll see

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:15.800
what the real deal looks like.

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:16.480
Oh, yeah!

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:17.520
Damn.

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:19.240
This match will be intense.

00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:20.960
but I think Boss will definitely win.

00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:23.760
Hey, Hill.

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:24.960
We've got to win

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:26.080
to look cool.

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:26.600
So,

00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:27.480
let’s get fired up.

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:28.400
- Huh?
- What?

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:29.640
Get fired up.

00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:30.400
- Huh?
- That's cool?

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:31.080
Yeah, cool.

00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:31.480
Really?

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:32.320
Fine.

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.760
Bay, Hill, Pao, then…

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:34.880
Fighting Osu!

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:35.880
Bay, Hill, Pao?

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:36.520
This is cool?

00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:37.080
It is cool.

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:37.840
Right…

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:38.960
- Go.
- One, two, three!

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:41.920
Bay! Hill! Pao!

00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:42.840
What the heck?

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:43.600
Let’s go!

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:44.240
Osu!

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:45.480
Come on!

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:46.160
Come on!

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:49.080
They're intimidated.

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:49.560
Come on!

00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:50.120
Alright.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:51.560
Let’s start!

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:53.080
[blows whistle]

00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:56.040
[grunts]

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:57.640
[grunts]

00:34:58.080 --> 00:34:59.240
Yeah!

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:00.760
[blows whistle]

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:02.800
- Go, Boss!
- Point for this team!

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:03.480
[grunts]

00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:04.680
Yeah!

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:07.680
This is tough!

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:09.080
Hurry up and serve!

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:12.480
Where did the ball go?

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:22.080
I got it!

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:23.160
Here!

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:23.840
Got it?

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:24.720
Ouch!

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:27.880
[excited cheering]

00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:29.440
Yeah!

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:31.440
This team scored again!

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:33.400
Right now, both teams

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:35.120
are just one point apart.

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:36.960
If Boss' team scores again,

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:37.960
it's over.

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:39.000
And Pao…

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:41.720
will get to do the barbecue.

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:43.840
Hey.

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:45.560
I asked you to be a referee,

00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:46.800
not a sports commentator.

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:48.200
Aw, come on.

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:49.080
I'm being a delight.

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:50.440
A delight, my ass.

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:50.720
Dude.

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:51.920
You're insulting on us.

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:52.320
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:55.560
Huh.

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:01.920
Final point, huh?

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:04.000
Let's end this game right here.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.080
Wow… Listen to Mr. Art over here.

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:08.040
He’s looking down on us, Hill!

00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:09.560
- Yeah, give him hell.
- Go for it.

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:11.000
Don't count

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:12.480
your chickens.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:13.320
Huh?

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:14.200
- Huh?
- What?

00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:15.200
Wait a second, Hill.

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:15.680
It's weird.

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:16.040
Yeah.

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:16.840
What's that?

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:17.960
Why are you looking at us?

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:18.520
You insulting us?

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:19.680
A compliment.

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:20.320
A compliment!

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:21.480
We're fierce roosters.

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:21.840
Exactly.

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:22.320
- Go!
- Go!

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:23.920
- We will win!
- Fight!

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:24.320
Yeah!

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:25.280
Let's go!

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:26.280
- Come on!
- Focus!

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:26.600
Go!

00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:33.520
[blows whistle]

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.000
- Alright!
- Yeah!

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:37.440
There.

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:39.000
It's up to you now, Bay!

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:40.520
Whoa.

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:41.800
A perfect set for you, Hill.

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:43.080
I’m counting on you!

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:43.960
I got you, bro.

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:08.120
Damn!

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:09.720
I…

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:10.680
I'm sorry, Boss.

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:12.960
Hill, worry about your own team first!

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:15.200
Smash it, Hill!

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:16.000
You're our hope!

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:16.760
Smash it!

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:26.880
- Smash it!
- Smash it!

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:51.280
- Crap!
- Shit!

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:21.160
Whoa!

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:22.400
Damn!

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:30.240
Bay.

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:30.600
Huh?

00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:32.640
Pao's so mad his face turns red.

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:39.720
I don’t think so.

00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:41.440
Half his face is red.

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:43.360
I think that’s from
getting hit by the ball.

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:46.040
Thanks to you, Hill.

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:49.400
But at least

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:50.280
you won Boss’ heart.

00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:51.720
And?

00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:54.400
You won barbecue duty, idiot.

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:54.960
Ow!

00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:57.640
Damn, that hurts like hell.

00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:59.160
Hey, over here!

00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:00.000
Going to treat it.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:00.600
Going to treat it.

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:02.560
Hill,

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:04.600
you just need to smash it.

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:20.840
Pao.

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:22.760
I’m really sorry.

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:26.920
I’ll grill just one piece.

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:28.200
You handle the rest.

00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:29.720
Got it.

00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:31.240
Don’t take it too hard, P’Pao.

00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:32.320
Losing’s not a big deal.

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:34.720
The winner just gets to eat first.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.320
Look, a flamingo.

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:38.720
Yeah, a flamingo.

00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:40.800
That turned into…

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:41.520
…grilled chicken.

00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:42.320
The flamingo.

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:42.960
Flamingo?

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:43.720
Right here.

00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:45.920
Be quick

00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:47.120
and finish grilling.

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:48.160
I’ll take this

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:49.120
over there first.

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:49.400
Okay?

00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:50.160
Hurry up, okay?

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:50.840
Got it.

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:51.200
Good.

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:52.440
I’ll leave it to you.

00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:53.120
Sure thing.

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:53.600
Alright.

00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:54.800
Let’s go.

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:55.400
I’m hungry.

00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:01.760
That's so much food.

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:11.960
I’ll be right back.

00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:19.480
[clears throat]

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:24.040
This game is over.

00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:27.120
I’d better go get ready.

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:29.280
That's burnt.

00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:49.800
Can I sit here?

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:53.840
You're asking?

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:55.680
That’s oddly polite of you.

00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:58.080
Oh,

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:00.000
so being polite’s a problem?

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.560
so being polite’s a problem?

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:02.880
How is it?

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:05.680
Chef Bay’s black pepper pork steak

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:06.960
guaranteed by…

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:08.040
…four Michelin tires.

00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:08.840
Tasty?

00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:11.440
Isn't it Michelin stars?

00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:14.000
Anything else?

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.080
I’ll sit with the others.

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:16.240
Hey, wait.

00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:23.360
I like you, Phat.

00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:27.240
Can you stop already?

00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:30.760
It could just be

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:32.960
a fleeting feeling, like with the others.

00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:34.760
What?

00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:35.440
Say it again.

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:37.120
The waves are… loud.

00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:47.400
I’m completely certain

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:51.320
about how I feel for you. It’s real.

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:54.560
I…

00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:57.680
I can’t hold myself back anymore.

00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:02.960
From the moment I met you

00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:05.720
up to that night,

00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:08.320
none of it was shallow.

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:14.280
Are you sure

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:17.040
you won’t get tired of me?

00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:21.640
Everything that’s happened,

00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:23.080
including that night,

00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:25.520
made me feel genuinely happy.

00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:29.720
So much that it scares me.

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:32.920
Well…

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:34.480
About what?

00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:43.920
I’m afraid I’ll end up like
the others you’ve been with.

00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:56.160
My feelings for you went

00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:58.280
from zero to a hundred.

00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:03.400
You’ve made me realize what real love is.

00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:24.000
Sorry I made you uncomfortable.

00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:27.840
I can wait.

00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:31.840
But I want you

00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:32.680
to know that

00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:36.520
I don’t want you to fight for us all alone.

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:41.200
I want to prove to you

00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:43.960
that I’m worthy of you.

00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:06.680
I also don’t want to keep
lying to myself anymore.

00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:19.320
Since that time…

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:22.120
I’ve always worn the ring you gave me.

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:26.080
I'm sorry…

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:29.480
for lying to myself all this time.

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:34.040
I like you, Bay.

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:07.400
Oh, Boss.

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:08.880
Are you okay?

00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:10.520
The pork

00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:13.120
is a little raw.

00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:14.120
Oh.

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:17.440
Then,

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:18.040
you can

00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:19.040
wait at the table.

00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:19.640
I’ll handle

00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:20.280
this myself.

00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:23.360
Let me. Because I

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:24.000
won't burn it.

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:25.600
Boss.

00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:27.280
Have faith in me.

00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:28.960
Just kidding.

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:30.720
I want you to rest a bit.

00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:32.960
You’ve done enough.

00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:35.240
Well…

00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:36.520
This is…

00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:37.320
It's just

00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:38.960
something

00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:40.080
I have to do

00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:41.480
as a loser, isn't it?

00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:45.360
You really take competitions seriously.

00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:47.960
Thanks for today.

00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:49.840
What for?

00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:53.080
Everything.

00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:54.560
Like…

00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:55.880
When we were playing

00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:57.960
volleyball.

00:45:58.440 --> 00:45:59.400
Thanks for

00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:01.320
not hitting a spike.

00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:07.920
If I could go back in time, Boss…

00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:09.160
I’d still

00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:11.760
choose to lose to you.

00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:13.880
So I could protect you.

00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:23.120
I've got a question.

00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:25.560
Sure.

00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:28.000
If one day

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:30.960
you find out

00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:33.680
Yuka lied to you,

00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:36.440
would you be angry?

00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:39.760
Why do you feel guilty about Yuka?

00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:41.360
I mean,

00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:42.880
Yuka and Junji

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:44.320
are the same person.

00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:45.840
And I’m sure,

00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:47.680
people like Junji

00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:51.000
never intend to hurt others’ feelings.

00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:57.000
If Yuka lied to me,

00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:00.000
I probably won't be angry.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:00.240
I probably won't be angry.

00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:02.640
Because I believe

00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:04.920
that she

00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:07.160
must have had

00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:10.960
a good reason for it.

00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:25.760
As thanks,

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:26.520
I will

00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:27.840
make you a steak.

00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:43.880
Here.

00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:49.000
This pork steak is for you.

00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:51.720
Wow…

00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:53.800
Is it edible, Boss?

00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:56.480
Then don’t eat it.

00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:57.320
Hang on.

00:47:57.320 --> 00:47:58.360
I was just kidding.

00:47:58.360 --> 00:47:59.320
Boss…

00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:00.000
you can sulk too, huh?

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.440
you can sulk too, huh?

00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:06.120
Boss…

00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:09.160
What?

00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:10.840
Well…

00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:11.720
didn’t you say

00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:13.120
you're giving it to me?

00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:25.840
Oh damn!

00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:27.600
Boss.

00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:28.920
It’s really delicious.

00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:30.200
It's so tender

00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:30.680
and

00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:32.120
that juicy gravy sauce

00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:33.120
is amazing.

00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:33.840
Boss,

00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:35.120
I mean it.

00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:36.600
Open a restaurant.

00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:38.720
If I did,

00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:39.760
I wouldn't let you help.

00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:40.200
Why?

00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:41.840
The customers might say

00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:42.960
it’s not good.

00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:44.120
Jeez…

00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:45.440
Boss, you’re being mean.

00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:48.080
Want to try mine?

00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:49.120
- Here.
- Okay.

00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:50.080
Let’s see.

00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:50.760
Here.

00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:52.000
Boss, fancy a bite?

00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:53.360
I’m full.

00:48:58.880 --> 00:48:59.520
Boss,

00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:01.440
Art said

00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:02.880
he wants to show you something.

00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:04.360
Said it's all prepared.

00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:05.680
Oh.

00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:06.640
Alright.

00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:08.080
Shall we go now?

00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:08.840
Let’s go.

00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:11.960
Come with us, Hill.

00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:12.880
Art said

00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:14.280
the client's work is all done

00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:15.160
and ready to present.

00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:21.560
- Boss, let’s go.
- Sure.

00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:47.480
Junji.

00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:15.640
You prepared all this?

00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:16.920
Yes.

00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:20.040
I prepared all of this for you, Junji.

00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:22.880
This is the grand,

00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:24.960
perfect finale of this game.

00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:33.760
The reason I came back

00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:37.440
is because I want you to know

00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:40.560
I'll stand by your side again.

00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:42.920
And help you succeed at everything.

00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:46.760
Like when we worked on
"Yuka! Love Me Please."

00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:00.000
Just a second.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:00.080
Just a second.

00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:06.080
Wow.

00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:18.920
Now,

00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:20.120
I know that my heart

00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:23.720
is with you.

00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:26.880
So…

00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:31.040
please forgive me.

00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:31.440
Man,

00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:32.800
this isn’t

00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:34.760
just presenting a project to him.

00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:35.880
This is like

00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:37.720
a surprise proposal to Boss!

00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:38.440
Seriously?

00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:38.760
Damn.

00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:41.000
He went all out.

00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:46.560
- Dude.
- Hey!

00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:47.640
Where are you going?

00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:48.840
Hill!

00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:53.240
Jeez.

00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:29.000
I love you and it’s driving me crazy.

00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:31.760
Wait, wait, wait.

00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:35.520
I know how you feel.

00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:38.480
We’ve kissed, we’ve hold each other,

00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:39.760
but I want to hear it.

00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:42.600
Let me hear it.

00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:46.960
I like you too.

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:42.080
Hello, Hill.

00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:43.520
It’s been a long time.

00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:44.920
I’ve missed you so much.

00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:46.560
How are you?

00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:49.360
I'm fine.

00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:52.000
I’m sorry…

00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:53.880
…that lately,

00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:56.440
I haven’t talked to you much.

00:53:57.120 --> 00:53:58.360
It’s totally fine.

00:53:58.360 --> 00:53:59.600
I'm always right here.

00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:01.600
You can see me anytime.

00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:04.320
Is there anything you want me to do?

00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:06.560
Well…

00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:08.560
Nothing really, Yuka.

00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:11.360
I’m just sitting by the sea.

00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:14.400
It’s beautiful.

00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:17.080
I just

00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:18.200
don’t want to be alone.

00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:22.520
I’m glad the sea is beautiful.

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.920
But since you don’t want to be alone,

00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:27.120
does that mean you’re lonely?

00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:28.760
Well…

00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:31.320
I guess

00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:33.560
you could call it that.

00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:36.920
If that’s how you see it.

00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:41.760
Do you want me to keep you company?

00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:46.440
Mm…

00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:47.840
Then I…

00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:49.560
Can I ask you something?

00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:53.160
If there's

00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:55.680
something you wanted to say

00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:58.200
but

00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:00.000
you missed the chance to say it…

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:01.800
you missed the chance to say it…

00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:04.640
If it were you,

00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:07.200
what would you do?

00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:10.400
If you didn’t seize that chance,

00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:11.560
it’s no big deal.

00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:14.080
If it were me,

00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:17.680
I’d create the opportunity myself.

00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:20.720
Yeah…

00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:21.480
I see.

00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:23.680
Thank you so much, Yuka.

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:26.680
I believe

00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:27.600
that saying it out loud

00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:29.200
is better than keeping it inside.

00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:30.800
Ganbatte ne!

00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:31.360
Hill.

00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:53.320
So you’re here.

00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:56.280
I’ve been looking for you.

00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:05.120
The sponsored game scene

00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:06.760
in your style,

00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:08.960
how's it going?

00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:12.400
Well,

00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:15.320
did you like Art’s work?

00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:26.960
Be my boyfriend.

00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:32.400
Okay.

00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:34.360
I promise

00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:35.120
I’ll never leave.

00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:38.240
And I’ll hold you tight.

00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:40.480
That’s too tight.

00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:42.920
No, not tight enough.

00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:48.280
Hold on.

00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:54.280
Didn’t you say you’d hold me tight?

00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:55.200
Why’d you let go?

00:56:56.360 --> 00:56:57.440
That's not it.

00:56:57.440 --> 00:56:58.120
Phat, will you

00:56:58.120 --> 00:56:58.800
help me out?

00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:02.640
Hurry.

00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:11.520
I’m sorry

00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:14.040
for asking about someone else’s work.

00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:19.080
If I liked Art’s work,

00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:22.680
would I have walked over here?

00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:29.520
What about your work?

00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:31.360
What's it like?

00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:39.800
My scene?

00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:46.000
I think

00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:48.760
it has to be sincere.

00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:53.640
No need to try to make it flashy.

00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:57.720
Easy to understand

00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:00.000
and feel natural.

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:00.800
and feel natural.

00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:06.480
Because…

00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:09.120
I think

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:12.120
if it’s Yuka-chan,

00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:15.320
she wouldn’t like

00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:18.480
discussing personal matters publicly.

00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:22.720
Yuka-chan

00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:24.520
likes things simple.

00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:29.680
She’d probably just want to
hear the sound of the waves,

00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:33.560
calmly

00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:36.280
hitting the shore

00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:40.800
and…

00:58:45.360 --> 00:58:46.960
speak heart-to-heart.

00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:52.720
Just the two of us

00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:53.680
on the beach.

00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:56.160
I think

00:58:56.840 --> 00:58:58.680
she’d like that better.

00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:25.040
And I

00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:32.520
would hold her hand,

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:37.440
and thank her.

00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:41.680
Thank her

00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:44.400
for always encouraging me.

00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:48.960
Thank her

00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:52.200
for making me

00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:57.960
see my own self worth again.

01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:02.800
And I’d like to thank her

01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:07.800
for making

01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:09.680
my life

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:12.560
meaningful every single day.

01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:27.680
Junji-san

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:33.720
I love you.

01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:42.160
Hill…

01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:47.760
Are you telling me

01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:50.520
or

01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:55.920
Yuka?

01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:10.440
This is so pretty?

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:11.680
When you said

01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:13.080
to hurry over,

01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:14.800
you meant to do something like this?

01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:16.280
Of course.

01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:18.800
Hill planned to have fireworks in the game,

01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:20.960
but we still hadn’t decided

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:22.040
when to set them off.

01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:23.880
I thought this was the perfect time.

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:25.480
Cute.

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:28.760
You mean

01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:29.720
Hill?

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:31.360
No. You’re cute,

01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:32.520
doing something like this.

01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:35.360
Aw, come on…

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.240
But honestly,

01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:39.000
we only

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.440
planned this to help sell the project.

01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:41.960
How did it

01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:42.920
turn into that?

01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:44.840
Hill is really something, huh?

01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:50.320
[sighs]

01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:07.280
Look at them.

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:45.000
Beautiful?

01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:55.240
Hashtag,

01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:56.640
#BanYukaGame

01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:58.600
The real Yuka

01:03:58.600 --> 01:03:59.480
is Boss Junji,

01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:00.000
the famous CEO of PRISMSTAR Thailand.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.120
the famous CEO of PRISMSTAR Thailand.

01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:03.720
As for our relationship,

01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:05.320
it’s better not to jump the gun.

01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:07.840
Our parent company wants
to hold a press conference.

01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:08.440
What?

01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:10.320
So you revealed this

01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:12.080
to make Junji notice you?

01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:13.800
You have to leave Junji

01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:15.880
and resign from this company.

01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:19.320
What's your excuse?

01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:21.000
How do you plan to fix this?
